       " \"Our campus has a culture problem.  I'm a third-year here and I have had TWO classes (engl 1101 and fren 1001) with less than 25 people in it: both taken fall of my freshman year. Other than that: I've been in massive lecture halls and 40-70 person classrooms since I've started at Tech. In lecture style classes: you go to class: your professor teaches from a powerpoint or whiteboard examples: and then you leave. There is minimal collaboration or discussion: or any sort of opportunity to get to know your classmates or for your professor to get to know you. Georgia Tech hides these huge lecture numbers by splitting classes up by recitation: so if anyone were to look at purely the numbers: they would see it's a 40-50 person class when in actuality: there are 5 sections of the same lecture amounting to 250 people filed into Howey three times a week. The class sizes only continue to grow and the professor's lack of interest in the individual student continues to decrease. Professors are more focused on their research than the teaching aspect of being a professor. Sitting in a 100-200 person lecture hall is extremely isolating and makes it incredibly difficult to make a friend much beyond the person you sit next to in your unassigned assigned seat three times a week. We all have them. Those people you see on campus that you must have sat next to for months and you barely know their name. You compared answers and maybe talked about the class from time to time: but you probably don't know anything about them. The maximum collaboration we have in most classes is through Piazza. And wouldn't you know it: 99.9% of posts are posted anonymously: so you don't even know who's helping you and who's asking questions. What if you knew that 85% of the questions you asked were answered by the same person: wouldn't you want to know? Wouldn't you want to say thank you to the student putting in the time to help you? Possibly thank them? Be nicer to the people sitting around you: they're going through very similar stuff as you.\\n\",\n",

       " 'More on the professors- maybe it\\'s just me: but a lot of them need a course on mental health. Not the: \"\"these are the warning signs of depression\"\" or \"\"this is how you spot a suicidal student\"\" classes: but the \"\"making all of your students think they\\'re failing until the end of the semester and then curving the class at the end isn\\'t cool\"\" course. Having a student go MONTHS on end working their ass off: stressing out: thinking that they\\'re failing a class: and then you magically swooping in and \"\"making it work out\"\" in the end is not okay. I\\'m tired of being stressed all semester thinking I\\'m going to barely get a C in a class: only to pull out a B because you curve the class by 15 points. Put in the effort to make your exams accurately reflect the knowledge a person should have. If a person fails an exam: it should be because they failed to learn the material: not because the average was a 52: so really: they did better than a majority of the class. I\\'m tired of seeing my classmates as competitors. I\\'m in a class right now where an A is awarded to the top 20% of the class. I\\'m sure you\\'ll be \\\\~shocked\\\\~ to know that a majority of Piazza questions go unanswered because no one wants to help anyone get a better grade. Everyone is secretly hoping that everyone else does poorly: so they can look better. I get that this is how it is in the real world: but at least in the real world: you have allies. You have a department to work with or an IT guy to help you. Here: you\\'re in a massive lecture hall with no IT guy to joke with or Janice from HR to get lunch with. You\\'re by yourself and there\\'s no one leaving cake in the break room. Personally: my GPA doesn\\'t define me: but it does define the tens of thousands of dollars in tuition scholarship that I get: and without it: I can\\'t go to school here.

Either you live on campus in shoebox dorms from the 90s: you pay $1100/month to live in a boot-shoebox with your own bathroom right off-campus: or you live far enough away for it to be feasible. Either way: you're once again isolated. This semester is my first time living on west campus (glenn then uhouse before): and most of the time once I get back to my apartment after class: it takes a lot to convince me to walk the 1-2 miles to wherever my friends are hanging out. So I'm going to combine reddit's two favorite topics: mental health and PTS. Can you IMAGINE if it actually only took you like 5 minutes to get to the other side of campus? If you saw that the CRC was giving free classes and it would actually only take you 5 minutes waiting on a bus to get there?? Our campus is isolated: east vs. west: on vs. off and this has an inherent effect on mental health. If this is what gives them the funding they need: then so be it: but PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION CONNECTS OUR CAMPUS: SO IT NEEDS TO WORK and it needs to work well. Stressing out that I'm going to be late before I even get to the class that I'm failing is not fun.\\n\",\n",

Candy and junk food don\\'t have a positive effect on mental health. Sugar is bad for your health: we\\'ve learned this since the 3rd grade food pyramid. From a mental perspective: junk food makes you feel good while you eat it: and then you get hungry again in 5 minutes and you feel bad because you\\'ve eaten fattening food.

I could just picture our Georgia Tech themed wedding. The children we would create. We could dress them up in Georgia Tech PJs at night: take them to Georgia Tech football games and wrap them in little Georgia Tech blankets. Maybe they too would someday go to Georgia Tech. \"\"Well... it seems like a good start to me\"\" I replied. Red in the face she scurries up the stairs and inside the building I had just walked out of. Hmm... what did I do wrong? Was I coming on too strong? But she came on strong? Was there something on my face? No. Nothing was there in the mirror. Oh well...

When I was a freshman I failed my entire first round of exams (yup: every single one of them) and that totally bummed me out to say the least. I had never failed anything before: and I felt awful. I felt like I didn’t belong at Tech: I felt like everyone was smarter than me: and I felt like an imposter (just not the kind that can vent). But I’m a second year now and I’m doing great: so let me try to offer some advice:\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '1. **First things first: relax.** This isn’t the end of the world. You belong here just as much as anyone else does; remember: Tech doesn’t accept students with the intent to set them up for failure. This is just a bump in the road: and it does not foreshadow your entire journey. Everything will be ok. \\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '2. **You’re totally not alone.** This sort of thing happens to the best of us every once in a while. I know with the pandemic things can be really isolating: but don’t hesitate to reach out to your friends for comfort. Good friends won’t judge you for your academic performance. And hey: there’s a good chance they’ve gone through something similar. \\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '3. **It’s not too late.** Always always always reach out and ask for help. Tech has some pretty great resources that can help you get back on track: and now is the time to do it since the semester is still young. Go to office hours: your professors will be happy to help. One of the best things I did as a first year was going to academic coaching (props to Dr. Rodriguez): and I also started going to tutoring. There’s no shame in asking for help: and I’m a better student for it. As a bonus pro-tip for resources: PLUS isn’t all that helpful of you have no idea what you’re doing: so generally I recommend tutoring if you don’t understand a concept: but save PLUS for review. \\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '4. **You’re still learning.** Adjusting to college is hard. Adjusting to college at Tech is harder. Adjusting to college at Tech online during a global pandemic is... well: *unprecedented*. It takes a little while to get caught up to speed: but I believe in you! You’ve worked so hard to get to this point: and it can only go uphill from here. \\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'This post is kinda long: but I hope it at least helped a little. After applying some of the tips from above I’m a far more confident student: and my grades have been trending for the better. I also have a far healthier: less obsessive outlook on my academic performance. Did I do poorly on an exam recently? Yeah: but I just took the L and moved on: knowing I’ll be more prepared next time and everything will be ok. And look: everything is going to turn out ok for you too. So take care of your mental health: make sure you’re getting enough sleep: drink some water: and take a break from your homework every once in a while. It’s starting to cool down outside: so go for a walk (but wear a mask goddammit). When you take care of yourself first: everything will start to fall into place. It’s all about balance\\n',\n",

No one I know in the administration believes that we will complete the term in person: but it is entirely possible that the Board of Regents/USG will forbid us to close even as health conditions deteriorate. And sending students home: when we finally do it: will make them into vectors of infection for their traveling cohorts: families: and communities. Other Atlanta colleges are choosing to go remote: as are the Atlanta area public schools in multiple districts. My advice to students is to take advantage of the 20% of courses that will be delivered remotely: and to press the faculty listed as giving \"\"hybrid\"\" courses to allow remote participation.\":2020-07-22 00:39:16',\n",

       " \"Our campus has a culture problem.  I'm a third-year here and I have had TWO classes (engl 1101 and fren 1001) with less than 25 people in it: both taken fall of my freshman year. Other than that: I've been in massive lecture halls and 40-70 person classrooms since I've started at Tech. In lecture style classes: you go to class: your professor teaches from a powerpoint or whiteboard examples: and then you leave. There is minimal collaboration or discussion: or any sort of opportunity to get to know your classmates or for your professor to get to know you. Georgia Tech hides these huge lecture numbers by splitting classes up by recitation: so if anyone were to look at purely the numbers: they would see it's a 40-50 person class when in actuality: there are 5 sections of the same lecture amounting to 250 people filed into Howey three times a week. The class sizes only continue to grow and the professor's lack of interest in the individual student continues to decrease. Professors are more focused on their research than the teaching aspect of being a professor. Sitting in a 100-200 person lecture hall is extremely isolating and makes it incredibly difficult to make a friend much beyond the person you sit next to in your unassigned assigned seat three times a week. We all have them. Those people you see on campus that you must have sat next to for months and you barely know their name. You compared answers and maybe talked about the class from time to time: but you probably don't know anything about them. The maximum collaboration we have in most classes is through Piazza. And wouldn't you know it: 99.9% of posts are posted anonymously: so you don't even know who's helping you and who's asking questions. What if you knew that 85% of the questions you asked were answered by the same person: wouldn't you want to know? Wouldn't you want to say thank you to the student putting in the time to help you? Possibly thank them? Be nicer to the people sitting around you: they're going through very similar stuff as you.\",\n",

       " 'More on the professors- maybe it\\'s just me: but a lot of them need a course on mental health. Not the: \"\"these are the warning signs of depression\"\" or \"\"this is how you spot a suicidal student\"\" classes: but the \"\"making all of your students think they\\'re failing until the end of the semester and then curving the class at the end isn\\'t cool\"\" course. Having a student go MONTHS on end working their ass off: stressing out: thinking that they\\'re failing a class: and then you magically swooping in and \"\"making it work out\"\" in the end is not okay. I\\'m tired of being stressed all semester thinking I\\'m going to barely get a C in a class: only to pull out a B because you curve the class by 15 points. Put in the effort to make your exams accurately reflect the knowledge a person should have. If a person fails an exam: it should be because they failed to learn the material: not because the average was a 52: so really: they did better than a majority of the class. I\\'m tired of seeing my classmates as competitors. I\\'m in a class right now where an A is awarded to the top 20% of the class. I\\'m sure you\\'ll be \\\\~shocked\\\\~ to know that a majority of Piazza questions go unanswered because no one wants to help anyone get a better grade. Everyone is secretly hoping that everyone else does poorly: so they can look better. I get that this is how it is in the real world: but at least in the real world: you have allies. You have a department to work with or an IT guy to help you. Here: you\\'re in a massive lecture hall with no IT guy to joke with or Janice from HR to get lunch with. You\\'re by yourself and there\\'s no one leaving cake in the break room. Personally: my GPA doesn\\'t define me: but it does define the tens of thousands of dollars in tuition scholarship that I get: and without it: I can\\'t go to school here.

Either you live on campus in shoebox dorms from the 90s: you pay $1100/month to live in a boot-shoebox with your own bathroom right off-campus: or you live far enough away for it to be feasible. Either way: you're once again isolated. This semester is my first time living on west campus (glenn then uhouse before): and most of the time once I get back to my apartment after class: it takes a lot to convince me to walk the 1-2 miles to wherever my friends are hanging out. So I'm going to combine reddit's two favorite topics: mental health and PTS. Can you IMAGINE if it actually only took you like 5 minutes to get to the other side of campus? If you saw that the CRC was giving free classes and it would actually only take you 5 minutes waiting on a bus to get there?? Our campus is isolated: east vs. west: on vs. off and this has an inherent effect on mental health. If this is what gives them the funding they need: then so be it: but PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION CONNECTS OUR CAMPUS: SO IT NEEDS TO WORK and it needs to work well.

When I was a freshman I failed my entire first round of exams (yup: every single one of them) and that totally bummed me out to say the least. I had never failed anything before: and I felt awful. I felt like I didn’t belong at Tech: I felt like everyone was smarter than me: and I felt like an imposter (just not the kind that can vent). But I’m a second year now and I’m doing great: so let me try to offer some advice:',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '1. **First things first: relax.** This isn’t the end of the world. You belong here just as much as anyone else does; remember: Tech doesn’t accept students with the intent to set them up for failure. This is just a bump in the road: and it does not foreshadow your entire journey. Everything will be ok.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '2. **You’re totally not alone.** This sort of thing happens to the best of us every once in a while. I know with the pandemic things can be really isolating: but don’t hesitate to reach out to your friends for comfort. Good friends won’t judge you for your academic performance. And hey: there’s a good chance they’ve gone through something similar.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '3. **It’s not too late.** Always always always reach out and ask for help. Tech has some pretty great resources that can help you get back on track: and now is the time to do it since the semester is still young. Go to office hours: your professors will be happy to help. One of the best things I did as a first year was going to academic coaching (props to Dr. Rodriguez): and I also started going to tutoring. There’s no shame in asking for help: and I’m a better student for it. As a bonus pro-tip for resources: PLUS isn’t all that helpful of you have no idea what you’re doing: so generally I recommend tutoring if you don’t understand a concept: but save PLUS for review.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '4. **You’re still learning.** Adjusting to college is hard. Adjusting to college at Tech is harder. Adjusting to college at Tech online during a global pandemic is... well: *unprecedented*. It takes a little while to get caught up to speed: but I believe in you! You’ve worked so hard to get to this point: and it can only go uphill from here.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'This post is kinda long: but I hope it at least helped a little. After applying some of the tips from above I’m a far more confident student: and my grades have been trending for the better. I also have a far healthier: less obsessive outlook on my academic performance. Did I do poorly on an exam recently? Yeah: but I just took the L and moved on: knowing I’ll be more prepared next time and everything will be ok. And look: everything is going to turn out ok for you too. So take care of your mental health: make sure you’re getting enough sleep: drink some water: and take a break from your homework every once in a while. It’s starting to cool down outside: so go for a walk (but wear a mask goddammit). When you take care of yourself first: everything will start to fall into place. It’s all about balance',\n",
