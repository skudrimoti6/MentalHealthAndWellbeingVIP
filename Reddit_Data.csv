GoFundMe for injured Officers and GTPD: https://www.gofundme.com/gtpd-officer-recovery

Dear Protesters, specifically those of you shouting ""Fuck the police"";

You are a disgrace to this school, this city, and this country. You are violent animals using a tragic death as an excuse to act like such. You're voices are not being heard, only your stupidity. 

Of course, everyone has a right to voice whatever opinion they may have, but do not turn our campus into a battleground for your senseless war on order.

What happened was a tragedy, and GTPD responded in the best way they could. It has since been revealed that the victim has called the police reporting that they had a gun with them as well. GTPD was incredibly tolerant, gave the person ample time to disarm themselves, comply with police, and end the situation calmly. This did not happen unfortunately, and instead they continued to walk towards an officer, knife in hand, and reportedly with a gun.

DEAR GTPD: These protest do not voice the opinion of your school. We respect you and appreciate everything you do for us each and every day. The other night, one of your officers was presented with a nearly unimaginable situation. We understand the events that occurred and the unfathomable decision that had to be made. WE LOVE AND SUPPORT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.",2017-09-19 05:44:23

Death of Officer James Cornacchia,822,gwo3v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/gwo3v7/death_of_officer_james_cornacchia/,29,1591327109,"On June 1, 2020, Officer James Cornacchia of the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) lost his battle with Covid-19.  He served the Georgia Tech community for nearly 20 years and most recently worked as part of our patrol unit. He was a loving father, husband, brother, son and friend.  Officer Cornacchia was a valued member of the Georgia Tech community and will be sorely missed.

During this difficult time, we ask that you keep his family and friends in your thoughts and prayers.  Please take some time to learn more about Officer James Cornacchia [https://gf.me/u/x649v5](https://gf.me/u/x649v5)

 Officer Cornacchia was last on campus May 12, and he did not develop symptoms within 48 hours of that day. Out of an abundance of caution, all GTPD officers have been tested for Covid-19. Each of those tests came back negative. Georgia Tech continues to strictly follow guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

My story of what it’s been like being symptomatic for covid at Georgia Tech,722,i8o8n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/i8o8n8/my_story_of_what_its_been_like_being_symptomatic/,70,1597301745,"I moved in to campus on Sunday, I was coming from pretty far away, up by Chicago and so the two days before I had driven about 10 hours. I got to campus, started getting to get to know my roommate and had a good first day together. 

Starting around 2:30 on Monday, I started to get a headache and felt just a little feverish. I used the crappy liquid crystal thermometer they gave us and it was reading a mild fever. At this point, my main prerogative was not getting others, especially my roommate, sick. So, I went outside to my car and tried to schedule an appointment at Stamps… I was outside from this point until 10 PM except a couple of minutes inside to fill up my water.

It was really quite difficult to schedule an appointment at Stamps, I couldn’t find the location online, and it took me a while to call and reach them. At the point I called them, it was 3:14 PM. The nurse I talked to said that after 3PM they don’t schedule anything for the same day. If you start getting potential covid-like symptoms, CALL BEFORE THREE PM!

Around 3:50 I notified my RA of my symptoms and what was going on and asked for accommodations to sleep somewhere else so that I didn’t have to get my roommates sick. My RA through this point was really nice, responsive and generally helpful. My hall director through my RA eventually got back to me and told me that if I wanted to be tested today, I could go to an urgent care center… 

So I called up my sister and we both called all the urgent care centers on the list on Stamps’ website. The problem was, none of those urgent care centers had a rapid test. 

At this point, my RA became less responsive and I couldn’t get a definitive answer as to whether or not I could get modified sleeping arrangements for the night. So I called the RA on call and explained the situation who then called the Hall Director on call. I finally got a definitive answer. Housing said they wouldn’t do anything until I got a positive test. 

The only options I had at this point was 1) go to the ER to get a test 2) sleep in my car and get tested in the morning or 3) sleep in my dorm and get tested in the morning. I wasn’t really a fan of any of those options. I didn’t want to go to the ER, because if the ER declares it a non-emergency I’d be stuck with a massive bill, my parents didn’t want me to sleep in the car for understandable reasons, and I didn’t want to sleep in my room for obvious reasons. 

Sadly I didn’t really have much of a choice, and I ended up sleeping in my room with my mask on. As you can imagine, sleeping with a mask on wasn’t that fun, but was the right decision. 

Tuesday morning came around. I was still running a fever but my headache was gone and I was overall feeling better. I went to stamps around 10:30 and got the symptomatic test. The doctor who performed it was nice and told me they’d call me within an hour or two with the results. 

I went back to my dorm (my roommate was out exploring campus) and ate some leftovers that I had. The doctor called me back pretty quick and said that I tested negative. After we talked about my symptoms, which at that point was really just a fever, a headache and very very mild achiness in my neck, she was still very concerned because the test, especially early on, has a high false negative rate, that I had been running a fever for almost 24 hours at that point, and that my symptoms although mild were consistent with covid. Because of these reasons, she wanted me to get moved to the isolation location. She called up housing and talked with them, and then she called me back. By 2:15 I had packed my bags and I was on my way to the isolation location.

The isolation location is a hotel just east of campus and it’s very nice, food gets delivered twice a day and it’s not bad food so far. 

Now is Day three I guess of symptoms, I’m still running the fever and now I’m getting more symptoms consistent with covid such as achiness everywhere as though I had a massive workout yesterday. I haven’t been actually diagnosed yet, but I’m guessing based on these new symptoms I’m having that I’ll be clinically diagnosed tomorrow when the doc calls back and we talk. 

That’s pretty much where I am right now below are some of my takeaways and feel free to ask questions if you’d like.

1. If you feel any symptoms what so-ever consistent with covid go online to stamps and try to schedule an appointment and if you have any trouble CALL BEFORE 2:30 PM! Once you get an appointment to talk with a doc everything is smooth (they stop scheduling appointments if you call after 3PM)
2. Very mild or single symptoms can be covid! I started out with just a mild fever and headache which doesn’t scream covid to me, but the symptoms now do 
3. If you have ANY symptoms, try to get away from everyone ASAP to stop the spread, this could be telling your roommate and getting them to stay out, or you staying out if you feel okay staying outside at that time. 
4. Dealing with Housing was the worst part of this situation for me, if your hall director is in, call them, if they aren’t, call RA on call to contact the hall director on call.
5. People are going to get sick, and it’s up to each of us to recognize symptoms early on and act on those symptoms. When I talked to my parents the first day, they were 100% confident that I couldn’t possibly have covid. If you have ANY symptoms, act on it, don’t dismiss it!
6. WEAR A MASK
7. Get your surveillance test done as often as possible
8. Take your temperature at least once a day
9. EAT IN YOUR DORM ROOM OR OUTSIDE WITH YOUR ROOMMATE, just because you are eating doesn’t mean covid can’t spread. Not being able to eat with new people sucks, but that’s life. The only person you should be unmasked by is your roommate, including when you eat.

This is up to us. Tech could be doing more, and honestly should be doing more. But if we want this school year to happen, we have to do everything we can to stop the spread as quickly as possible.",2020-08-13 02:55:45

I am a full professor at Georgia Tech and an Associate Dean, and I sit in on multiple meetings a week around planning the re-opening of the campus. I am increasingly concerned that it is not safe for students to return to campus next month. Hospitals in Georgia are under pressure and the Governor is taking an unscientific position and actively opposing the reasonable science-driven restrictions recommended by the Mayor of Atlanta. Cases are spiking. No one I know in the administration believes that we will complete the term in person, but it is entirely possible that the Board of Regents/USG will forbid us to close even as health conditions deteriorate. And sending students home, when we finally do it, will make them into vectors of infection for their traveling cohorts, families, and communities. Other Atlanta colleges are choosing to go remote, as are the Atlanta area public schools in multiple districts. My advice to students is to take advantage of the 20% of courses that will be delivered remotely, and to press the faculty listed as giving ""hybrid"" courses to allow remote participation.",2020-07-22 00:39:16

hot take: it's a campus culture problem,595,a3j5i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/a3j5i6/hot_take_its_a_campus_culture_problem/,178,1544089306,"disclaimer: i'm not saying the counseling center doesn't deserve more funding or to not be restructured, but there are other things at fault here.

&#x200B;

Our campus has a culture problem.  I'm a third-year here and I have had TWO classes (engl 1101 and fren 1001) with less than 25 people in it, both taken fall of my freshman year. Other than that, I've been in massive lecture halls and 40-70 person classrooms since I've started at Tech. In lecture style classes, you go to class, your professor teaches from a powerpoint or whiteboard examples, and then you leave. There is minimal collaboration or discussion, or any sort of opportunity to get to know your classmates or for your professor to get to know you. Georgia Tech hides these huge lecture numbers by splitting classes up by recitation, so if anyone were to look at purely the numbers, they would see it's a 40-50 person class when in actuality, there are 5 sections of the same lecture amounting to 250 people filed into Howey three times a week. The class sizes only continue to grow and the professor's lack of interest in the individual student continues to decrease. Professors are more focused on their research than the teaching aspect of being a professor. Sitting in a 100-200 person lecture hall is extremely isolating and makes it incredibly difficult to make a friend much beyond the person you sit next to in your unassigned assigned seat three times a week. We all have them. Those people you see on campus that you must have sat next to for months and you barely know their name. You compared answers and maybe talked about the class from time to time, but you probably don't know anything about them. The maximum collaboration we have in most classes is through Piazza. And wouldn't you know it, 99.9% of posts are posted anonymously, so you don't even know who's helping you and who's asking questions. What if you knew that 85% of the questions you asked were answered by the same person, wouldn't you want to know? Wouldn't you want to say thank you to the student putting in the time to help you? Possibly thank them? Be nicer to the people sitting around you, they're going through very similar stuff as you.

More on the professors- maybe it's just me, but a lot of them need a course on mental health. Not the, ""these are the warning signs of depression"" or ""this is how you spot a suicidal student"" classes, but the ""making all of your students think they're failing until the end of the semester and then curving the class at the end isn't cool"" course. Having a student go MONTHS on end working their ass off, stressing out, thinking that they're failing a class, and then you magically swooping in and ""making it work out"" in the end is not okay. I'm tired of being stressed all semester thinking I'm going to barely get a C in a class, only to pull out a B because you curve the class by 15 points. Put in the effort to make your exams accurately reflect the knowledge a person should have. If a person fails an exam, it should be because they failed to learn the material, not because the average was a 52, so really, they did better than a majority of the class. I'm tired of seeing my classmates as competitors. I'm in a class right now where an A is awarded to the top 20% of the class. I'm sure you'll be \~shocked\~ to know that a majority of Piazza questions go unanswered because no one wants to help anyone get a better grade. Everyone is secretly hoping that everyone else does poorly, so they can look better. I get that this is how it is in the real world, but at least in the real world, you have allies. You have a department to work with or an IT guy to help you. Here, you're in a massive lecture hall with no IT guy to joke with or Janice from HR to get lunch with. You're by yourself and there's no one leaving cake in the break room. Personally, my GPA doesn't define me, but it does define the tens of thousands of dollars in tuition scholarship that I get, and without it, I can't go to school here. So don't tell me that I shouldn't stress about the grade to begin with. 

From a spatial perspective- housing here SUCKS. Either you live on campus in shoebox dorms from the 90s, you pay $1100/month to live in a boot-shoebox with your own bathroom right off-campus, or you live far enough away for it to be feasible. Either way, you're once again isolated. This semester is my first time living on west campus (glenn then uhouse before), and most of the time once I get back to my apartment after class, it takes a lot to convince me to walk the 1-2 miles to wherever my friends are hanging out. So I'm going to combine reddit's two favorite topics: mental health and PTS. Can you IMAGINE if it actually only took you like 5 minutes to get to the other side of campus? If you saw that the CRC was giving free classes and it would actually only take you 5 minutes waiting on a bus to get there?? Our campus is isolated, east vs. west, on vs. off and this has an inherent effect on mental health. If this is what gives them the funding they need, then so be it, but PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION CONNECTS OUR CAMPUS, SO IT NEEDS TO WORK and it needs to work well. Stressing out that I'm going to be late before I even get to the class that I'm failing is not fun.

Administration- make classes smaller, hire professors that care, change the campus climate, and get more creative with your ""mental health initiatives"". I'm tired of free bowling, puppies and candy/snacks being advertised as a ""mental health initiative"". Bowling normally is like $3. It's not that I don't have $3, it's that I don't have the TIME to go. I'm too stressed out studying for the final in the class that I'm currently ""failing"" (without that mystical unknown curve) to \*walk\* a mile to the student center to go bowling. Candy and junk food don't have a positive effect on mental health. Sugar is bad for your health, we've learned this since the 3rd grade food pyramid. From a mental perspective, junk food makes you feel good while you eat it, and then you get hungry again in 5 minutes and you feel bad because you've eaten fattening food. This just in: gaining weight doesn't help your mental health.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: our counseling center needs more funding, but other things about this school affecting the general population need to be changed. this place is SO isolating, and I would rather be surrounded by people I know I can talk to than know that there's a paid professional that doesn't go here, that I don't know, that I can schedule an appointment with once a week.

&#x200B;

background: i'm a 3rd year IE, working two jobs to pay for school, and have been in therapy since I was in the 9th grade and tried to kill myself in 11th. i think a lot about mental health, TRUST ME, and this is just one opinion, but I feel it might have some value.

A couple clarifications about the F1 visa for people who don't know what it is...,556,hnvl3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/hnvl3l/a_couple_clarifications_about_the_f1_visa_for/,71,1594293156,"International student here, recently I've seen a lot of people on this sub spew completely incorrect statements about what an F1 visa is and what international students are allowed to do on an F1 visa. Here are a couple clarifications:

* We are allowed to stay in the US over the summer even without enrolling in classes.
* Typically, we are not allowed to take more than 1 online class per semester.
* Exemptions were made to the above rule when classes shifted online last spring.

I've seen people say that they can't understand why international students are raising such a fuss and why they want to come back to the US if classes move online. You're missing an important point - there are MANY of us who are still currently in the US. I moved in with family here, I have friends working remote internships and others who are taking online classes. Not all of us left in the spring!

For many of us, moving back home is not simple and easy. Internet at home isn't reliable, time zones affect our work schedule, travel is incredibly unsafe during this time, people might already have apartment leases taken out and others might only have families in countries that have a travel ban in place. I know it's a stereotype that international students are filthy rich but that's simply not true. We cannot drop thousands of dollars to buy flight tickets whenever the government decides to deport us. Yes I do recognize that our visa requires us to be enrolled in in-person classes but we're asking for compassion during such a difficult and trying time. Even though Tech is adopting a hybrid format, we still need some sort of reassurance that we will not be deported if Tech decides to change their format in the future.

I'm not angry that a lot of American students don't understand what or how our visa works - it makes sense that you don't know much about something that isn't related to you. But PLEASE do not spread false information when you do not know what we are going through. Please have some compassion for your fellow students. Many of us have worked our asses off to be here and just want the best education possible.",2020-07-09 07:12:36

I am not trolling or being a jerk, merely trying to offer a conflicting view on the killing of Scout Schultz. If you disagree, please comment and try to persuade me otherwise.

When you refuse to release your weapon and are a threat to the life and safety of anybody(this includes police officers), you lose your victim status. 

I am not sympathetic towards Scout in the slightest. Only sympathetic to the people suffering the side effects of this incident, Scout's friends, family, and the officer forced into taking a life.

This person was acting as a danger to everyone in the proximity, and the only reason we are referring to this person as a victim is because this person died before they were able to hurt anyone else.

What is this person a victim of? Their own actions?

Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes.

Referring to this person as a victim is an insult to every innocent person ever killed by a police officer. Those are victims. This person was a criminal.

Face coverings are not required in one’s own dorm room or suite, when alone in an enclosed office or study room, or in campus outdoor settings where social distancing requirements are met.

Anyone not using a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or must leave the area. Repeated refusal to comply with the requirement may result in discipline through the applicable conduct code for faculty, staff or students.

I am a PL living in a freshman experience residence hall and have always been eager to change the lives of new students. Yet, housing makes creating that community nearly impossible. Since I've joined housing, it's always been told to me that hall directors are there to help SSMs not only do their jobs but also help them with the emotional burden. Yet, the one time I've reached out for help, my issues are put on the back burner and I cant even make contact with my direct superior. In my opinion, no one in housing seems to know what they're doing. I was once, in a roundabout way, made to feel like a narc by the hall directors on duty when identifying a resident abusing alcohol. Everything going on is unacceptable.

The director of housing, Sheree Gibson, and other higher ups in housing have destroyed all the good things about the freshman experience and are setting up housing to receive applicants desperate for free housing. By eliminating half of the first year positions, I am expected to do double the work for an extremely minimal increase in pay. The stress that Sheree has added to my life is harming my relationship with my bf and going into next year I am now expected to do the job of 2 people and pursue my BME classwork and capstone.

All of the ivys have some form of pass/fail, be it mandatory or opt in; top tier non-ivy’s such as Stanford and Johns Hopkins have gone pass/fail; other top tier engineering programs such as Carnegie Mellon and Berkeley have gone pass/fail. 

Georgia Tech’s failure to adapt to the ongoing pandemic reflects a major flaw in the state of Georgia’s approach to combatting Covid-19. How can anyone expect students to be able to treat class normally when they have to combat things such as food shortages, increased mental health strain, and technology issues such as limited office hours and the general disconnect of virtual teaching. This is not Georgia Tech’s fault specifically, per se, but I think it’s disappointing how some people are sitting on a moral high horse and blaming the students when clearly they’re a result of their environment. Nobody asked for remote learning, but they had to adapt; the least USG could do was take off the pressure of destroying your GPA in the midst of a global health crisis.

Funny story about orientation,499,aic1lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/aic1lp/funny_story_about_orientation/,21,1548118789,"So there I was at my departmental orientation walking the campus and getting my bearings. It was surreal. I was at the school of my dreams walking in and out of buildings on this beautiful campus. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, this drop dead gorgeous girl approaches me, tugs my shoulder, looks up at me with her beautiful blue eyes and calmly says ""excuse me... is this love?"" I pinched myself. Is this real? College really is like the movies. I was shocked. What is a socially awkward engineer to do at a time like this? There was too much a stake. I could just picture our Georgia Tech themed wedding. The children we would create. We could dress them up in Georgia Tech PJs at night, take them to Georgia Tech football games and wrap them in little Georgia Tech blankets. Maybe they too would someday go to Georgia Tech. ""Well... it seems like a good start to me"" I replied. Red in the face she scurries up the stairs and inside the building I had just walked out of. Hmm... what did I do wrong? Was I coming on too strong? But she came on strong? Was there something on my face? No. Nothing was there in the mirror. Oh well... I figured I would shake it off and go ahead and sign up for classes, one of which I learned was in a building called the Love building. It clicked when I remembered that was the building I was walking out of when she approached me. ",2019-01-21 19:59:49

==========

Every single Georgia Tech administrative official should give this a look.

This was developed by several students who are concerned for those disproportionately affected by the lack of pass/fail. It's not just me, so don't shoot the messenger if you look through and disagree.

Tech is now *100% alone* among its peers in its lack of modifications to its grading policy. This document contains a table describing the policy modifications across the top 50 engineering universities, including links to each school's policies. Spoilers: 49 rows in green, one single row glaring in red.

Among universities with reputable engineering departments, **only at Georgia Tech** are significantly disadvantaged students being forced to either suck it up or withdraw. That is not who we are, and that is not how any comparable university is handling this. Whether we as individuals personally need help or not, everyone should be speaking up for our friends and classmates who do.

Please share this document with your friends, or your Piazza pages, or your professors, or your department chairs, or the Technique, or SGA, or the Georgia Tech social media pages, or Dr. Cabrera's twitter page... Whatever you're willing to do.

If you have any suggestions on how to give this more visibility, please comment.

Our president should put his foot down with the USG Board of Regents about this, or find an internal workaround involving Petitions to the Faculty, or join forces with the presidents of UGA and Georgia State to ask the governor to intervene on the matter... Or at least say *something* about this. When the needs of disadvantaged students at every single peer institution are being met, but those specifically at Georgia Tech cannot say the same, his silence is not acceptable.",2020-04-05 20:49:04

"Without warning, Department of Housing has chosen to lay off over 60 SSMs",437,f51tb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/f51tb3/without_warning_department_of_housing_has_chosen/,56,1581936141,"Without an email from anyone within Housing, my supervisor has let me know that I will not be returning to my position as an SSM (student staff member, i.e. RA/PL) at all, along with 59+ other SSMs throughout campus. We are being let off due to ""budget changes"", and not due to any performance measures. According to my supervisor, this decision was made several weeks ago by upper-level Housing staff, which has failed to notify any SSMs in any capacity since the decision was made. Those who were laid off have not been added to the alternate pool of new SSM candidates (at least, not automatically), but are welcome to reapply to become an SSM next Fall. Not only this, but opening positions from graduating students have been filled by incoming applicants, meaning that new, untrained applicants are being preferred over SSMs that have worked for Housing for several years. It's honestly insulting. By waiting so long to let us know, Housing has made it difficult to find a place to live during the summer. The deadline to apply for on-campus housing is in less than a week and it is now much harder to find an affordable lease for off-campus apartments for the summer.

It has become clear that Housing no longer cares about its employees, and for that matter, the students of Georgia Tech as well. SSMs are a front line of defense for mental health and wellbeing of students. In laying off 60 SSMs, Housing has effectively reduced the ability for Georgia Tech to reach out to students in need. Housing has recently increased SSM responsibilities, such as requiring an additional duty round and for SSMs to record resident conversations every week. When asked why these changes were made, especially without an increase in pay to compensate, they simply cited that ""other schools had such policies."" I used to say that the only department worse than Housing was Dining, but honestly Aramark has shown vast improvements in terms of service and care that Housing has not. I am ashamed to have been a part of this organization.",2020-02-17 05:42:21

During the eviction process, **the tenant is allowed to remain in possession of the property until there is a court decision**. During this time, the landlord cannot cut off utilities.

GT Housing Contract: [https://housing.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Contracts/2019-20\_academic\_year\_contract.pdf](https://housing.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Contracts/2019-20_academic_year_contract.pdf)

The information from this handbook is state law and supersedes ANYTHING in the housing contract. It is flat **illegal** for Georgia Tech to take possession of your dorm room without first serving you an eviction notice and filing an eviction in court. You must have at least 7 days to respond to the eviction notice in court before they can evict you.

Georgia Tech is trying to scare as many people off campus as possible so they can minimize the campus population (a reasonable goal, but they're being dishonest about it). Fuck Georgia Tech Housing. Stay as long as you need to. [Fill out the form to request to stay on housing](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bI22AhgcAOElikJ) and you can leave it at ""family situation"" or something vague. They're probably going to accommodate everybody who requests to stay.

Obviously it's a good idea for you to move out of campus and go home as soon as possible, don't stay if you are able to leave, but everybody needs to understand that housing is bluffing right now. You have a right to remain in possession of your dorm.

If you need a place to stay or store your things temporarily, use this form to request solidarity housing: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeapd9eMmdwkHANJeVWnsm0k7rRDVknoTqzQoMwatCC4olaAg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeapd9eMmdwkHANJeVWnsm0k7rRDVknoTqzQoMwatCC4olaAg/viewform)",2020-03-19 22:10:45

Fraternities and Sororities: Get Your Acts Together,435,ic4qm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/ic4qm6/fraternities_and_sororities_get_your_acts_together/,161,1597798291,"You would think that, after UNC's closure due to outbreaks and clusters of cases on their campus, we would see some changes in behavior from our fraternity and sorority community. **But I just saw members of ZTA, Sigma Chi, and KA on their lawns ignoring social distancing guidelines AND not wearing masks SIMULTANEOUSLY**. I thought we were smarter than this. At this rate, with 27 new cases since the 10th (the day after FE move-in) and flagrant disobedience of the guidelines, we are on track to close down too. Everyone's health and safety depends on this, so I'm not above publicly shaming certain srats to get this message across. **I did not put all that work into moving back down to Tech to have everything shut down again because srats can't follow simple guidelines.**

If you have had any contact with a srat member in the last week, you should strongly consider being tested for COVID immediately and avoid any other contact with them. I hate to generalize, but **there's zero way of knowing which srats are being responsible inside their houses and which ones aren't**. Don't take any chances - **just block them out**.

EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up as much as it did. But I want to make three things clear that weren’t explained by me but were addressed in the comments.

1. Yes, there are some srats that are doing their part and trying to abide by COVID guidelines. But the idea that any srat member who doesn’t live in the house can go interact with their brothers/sisters and potentially carry the virus to/from the house is extremely unsettling, and it’s clear from this thread that I’m not the only one who sees the danger in that. It’s the exact same reason that Housing is asking residents to not intermingle with residents living in other dorms for the first 8 weeks of the semester (as ineffective as that may be). They can’t always prevent the spread in dorms or larger dwellings, but they can try to prevent clusters from becoming unstoppable community spread.

2. Srats of course aren’t the only segment of the GT community that exhibits risky behavior during the pandemic. We all know this. But to display this irreverent behavior so publicly and shamelessly is truly deplorable. These srats that do so seem to think they’re above the guidelines, and they are in sore need of a reality check before they get someone killed.

3. Preventing the spread of the virus is never just about protecting yourself or others your age. It’s about everyone. So don’t try that shameful argument of “I’m 20 and indestructible.” Children have contracted this disease and died - you aren’t indestructible. And there are plenty of people on this campus or in commuters’ homes who are more vulnerable to complications and death than we are. So stop being selfish and put on a mask so no one else has to bury their parents, grandparents or other family members. PLEASE.",2020-08-18 20:51:31

Some comforting words..,432,a3a1t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/a3a1t8/some_comforting_words/,17,1544023394,"(Note: Not my words, this was an email sent to my friend by his TA for his MATH 2550 class. Thought they were really nice and uplifting though, and wanted to share.)

Dear students,

I was hesitant to say all of this at first, but in light of recent events, I’m going to voice some of my thoughts. Your worth as a person (even as an intellectual) is not tied to your grades, the jobs you’ve landed, or how much you’ve out-performed your peers. It is normal to be confused, to struggle, and to feel like you’re not capable. Sometimes, it feels like you’re going nowhere, accomplishing nothing. But that is simply not true. Your efforts are not in vain. Do not be discouraged by failure. Failure is okay, despite what others might say. Moreover, failure is often necessary to get to where you want in life.

Do not lose sight of what matters in life. Many of us have a strange sense of what “success” means. Success is not being the best at what you do. Success is being content with your life trajectory and working towards something you find worthwhile, meaningful, or satisfying. This “something” that you work towards does not have to change the face of history; it could just be carving out a simple living for yourself and doing things that make you happy.
 

We often get tunnel vision. We have a particular path that we think we should take, and if life doesn’t go the way we plan it, we can experience an array of feelings. We may become frustrated, feel insecure, or even feel scared. These feelings are normal. However, you should never ignore the many fruitful paths in life one can take. It’s not all about getting a prestigious job or performing some great intellectual feat. Satisfaction in life often lies where you don’t expect it.
 

You must do what it takes to feel good about life again. Don’t pay attention to societal expectations and what is considered “normal.” You don’t have to do what everyone else is doing to find your own success. You don’t have to get done in 4 years; you can take a semester or two off and go do something else. You can switch majors, or leave for a while and go work a job, or even leave Georgia Tech if that’s what’s best. I’m not telling you to give up on goals and dreams, but you must, above all else, feel good about life, and sometimes that requires changes, be they big or small.
 

You matter, and people care about you. Support each other.

Regards,
Zain",2018-12-05 10:23:14

I've always loved this area on campus, the fountain adds such a nice feature to the center of student activity. It not only provides a scenic spot but also some nice white noise while studying or eating outside. Not to mention the nice little mist you get if the wind is in your favor.

Now don't get me wrong, I like brick. Brick is cool. It's red, and that's cool (Although not as cool as white and gold), it's hard, it makes cool noises when you bike over it, and it's reasonably durable. But FOUNTAINS, man, water is just sooo much cooler than brick, don't ya think?

With all the effort tech has put into making campus look less sterile, I can't help but think this is a massive step backwards. I just don't get it...

Advice from one of my summer professors about the upcoming fall semester,404,hyz7at,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/hyz7at/advice_from_one_of_my_summer_professors_about_the/,77,1595907467,"“I was going to wait to send out this note, but I've heard students are making decisions about buying plane tickets, so...

I don't have time to go into all the reasons here as to why I believe this (a lot of it is ""inside baseball"" that I shouldn't reveal in detail and whose details would make little sense to you anyway), and it pains me to say this, but: although many, many people at Tech have worked very hard to try to create a safe in-person Fall semester... campus will basically be an unintentional bioweapons factory. I strongly recommend that you take all your classes remotely; you can contact professors in classes marked ""hybrid"" and ask if it can be done remotely. And if they say no, drop the class. 

I am speaking only for myself. Many of my colleagues agree with me; some are vocal about it, and others are keeping quiet about it. And some disagree with me, to varying degrees. 

But, NO ONE that I have spoken with believes that we will finish the semester on campus -- everyone believes that at some point there will be an outbreak and then in-person classes will be cancelled, so we'll be scrambling like we did in the Spring, sending all those students back home to spread Covid-19 to their home communities and give it to other people they might be on an airplane with. The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia is shoving us on a shockingly reckless path.

I hope the extra money in your pockets is worth the loss of sanity and financial security of SEVERAL of your students.

Just know that you are the ones taking away a students wage that they may need to feed themselves. You are the ones shutting them off from every social, emotional, and academic outlet. You are the ones increasing the ALREADY stressful PRESSURE that every GT student feels every. single. day.

GT says they care. That they worry about our mental health. That they want us to succeed. But literally y'all just care about the money and that's just disgusting to me.

GT is only the institution it is today because of every single student that has step foot on this campus. Do better and give us some basic respect. It's laughable that we have to beg for that.

Your students are not your servants. Give us what we deserve.

Sincerely, a student who is not even a PL/RA but is severely saddened by your lack of humanity. Like holy sh*t, this is a new low.

Lecture is not required, nor is recitation. I actually will not lecture and my TAs will not have office hours. Please understand that you are adults and need to take learning into your own hands. The tests will cover all course materials, but you are expected to learn the entire scope of the subject matter through self-teaching. I will assign an 800$ textbook written in Sanskrit. DO NOT READ FROM THIS BOOK. Grading will be as follows: Participation -10%, Quizzes 2.27%, Homework 1%, final 100%. Please hesitate to ask questions. You will be expected to glean all possible information from my lecture. I will devise a cipher using bongos and a cymbal to encode my lessons. Students should demonstrate a strong passion for learning by being intellectually able to understand the true meaning of my lectures. We will also assign a special section from the 7789 postgraduate class in Topological Quantum Field theory using Scratch. This will (not) (not) be on the final exam. The final exam will be held last week. You have all failed, and out of respect to the Georgia Tech motto “fucking die,” we have decided to invert the curve so that nobody will pass. I will be waiting in the bathroom with Percocets for all those who want to understand the true beauty of computer science”

“Ok time for lesson one: first baby steps. Does everyone know how to hold a pencil? Good, excellent. Now in a moment I will pass out pencils and you will all learn to write the alphabet on a sheet of paper. This is the letter A for “AGONY.” Remember it well. Lesson one is concluded. Turn to page 569 of the text. You will read backwards until you reach page 3, then rip out every log(569-x) page. Oh, you don’t have the textbook yet? Just transferred from our rival school, [nave], I see?”

Our prof reaches into the drawer and pulls out a handgun. She shoots the transfer student in the head.

“Didn’t I tell you to take learning into your own hands?”

She uses a swab to clean the gun, then presses it firmly into the transfer student’s right hand

“Lesson two is finding the orthonormal basis for the surface of a toroidal n-gon. YOU MUST USE NODE.js TO PRINT OUT THE ANSWER TO THIS PRINTER”

She points at a slightly rotting banana on the desk

“Furthermore, you must comment ‘I did not plagiarize this work from anyone. I worked on this code alone in my room and yes I was crying the whole time’ above every line of code. Keep the code short and efficient, must be max 20 characters”

The prof turns away from the class and stares longingly at the whiteboard. This goes on for around 30 minutes, some of the class try to leave but they get vaporized by the TAs the moment they open the door. In order to escape, the students perform the age old Tech tradition of vibrating at high frequencies to raise the air temperature and destroy the professor.

The students make buzzing noises like our beloved mascot buzz. Buzz buzz buzz (8 deaths from heat exhaustion). The professor begins to get restless from the rising heat. 

“Ok lesson 3, I fucking decimate you”

The ceiling begins to droop, and it is revealed that the entire room was the dean of the college of agriculture the whole time. 

“Why hello class” booms MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol

“Not MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol” whine the students in a bored monotone

All the buzzing ceases and the room returns to normal.

“This is the final exam”
The professor reveals compressed butane bombs hidden beneath the students’ chairs. Everyone clapped. 

“Looks like we’re finally getting a bump”

One kid in the back chuckles a little and the professor socks him with a lamp. She leaves the room and all the TA’s enter and begin to speak in perfect unison.

“You know, I was like you once. Fat, ugly, stupid. But then I learned Sanskrit and finally was able to read the text and it truly opened my eyes and made me not an inferior blind. Furthermore I gained immense intellectual capability and abandoned my ethnicity to become white” (all of them were already white) 

One of the TAs begins casually humping a table. MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol crushes him with a combine. 

“Witness the wonders of the agricultural sciences” he muses as Monsanto elevator music plays in the background

“Oh there goes MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol again, always a charmer”

The TAs begin crying in admiration. 

“Now that’s a donglong I would never hesitate to accept”

3 more students drop dead. Only 1527 of the original 1544 remain.

From the center of the student mass 80 new Tech students spawn.

“Oh hello, welcome to Guantanamo Bay - Atlanta campus”

“Ah we understand” says one of the replacement students, an Oriental man in his mid 40s.

“Oh fuck it’s Andrew Yang!” the TA’s scream. But before they can leave 1000 dollars in nickels has already been stuffed into their ears and they all die. 

The students mumble in despair “It’s Yang, we’re saved. woohoo. yeah. Yang2020 am i wrong or am i wrong?” 

“I have come to do battle with my long-standing rival, MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol” booms the Oriental

MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol uses his agriculture skills to circumvent the 8-fold path and achieve Nirvana, but Yang gets there first.

“Your lucky boy”

Yang rapidly injects 121951.219512 Icelandic Króna into MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol

“Nothing personnel kid. I will keep my promise to the American people”

“But the exchange fee! You would have to deduct 0.57% making it under 1000/month!”

“NO MRFARMERHUNKLONGDONGAOL YOU FINALLY REVEALED ME FOR THE FARCE THAT I AM. I AM DEFEATED”

Yang implodes into a fish ball. The nation of Botswana can be heard cheering in the distance.",2020-01-18 23:46:53

"So, you’re a freshman and you’ve just failed your first exam",388,iy53j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/iy53j8/so_youre_a_freshman_and_youve_just_failed_your/,31,1600872040,"No worries, we’ve all been there. When I was a freshman I failed my entire first round of exams (yup, every single one of them) and that totally bummed me out to say the least. I had never failed anything before, and I felt awful. I felt like I didn’t belong at Tech, I felt like everyone was smarter than me, and I felt like an imposter (just not the kind that can vent). But I’m a second year now and I’m doing great, so let me try to offer some advice:

1. **First things first, relax.** This isn’t the end of the world. You belong here just as much as anyone else does; remember, Tech doesn’t accept students with the intent to set them up for failure. This is just a bump in the road, and it does not foreshadow your entire journey. Everything will be ok. 

2. **You’re totally not alone.** This sort of thing happens to the best of us every once in a while. I know with the pandemic things can be really isolating, but don’t hesitate to reach out to your friends for comfort. Good friends won’t judge you for your academic performance. And hey, there’s a good chance they’ve gone through something similar. 

3. **It’s not too late.** Always always always reach out and ask for help. Tech has some pretty great resources that can help you get back on track, and now is the time to do it since the semester is still young. Go to office hours, your professors will be happy to help. One of the best things I did as a first year was going to academic coaching (props to Dr. Rodriguez), and I also started going to tutoring. There’s no shame in asking for help, and I’m a better student for it. As a bonus pro-tip for resources: PLUS isn’t all that helpful of you have no idea what you’re doing, so generally I recommend tutoring if you don’t understand a concept, but save PLUS for review. 

4. **You’re still learning.** Adjusting to college is hard. Adjusting to college at Tech is harder. Adjusting to college at Tech online during a global pandemic is... well, *unprecedented*. It takes a little while to get caught up to speed, but I believe in you! You’ve worked so hard to get to this point, and it can only go uphill from here. 

This post is kinda long, but I hope it at least helped a little. After applying some of the tips from above I’m a far more confident student, and my grades have been trending for the better. I also have a far healthier, less obsessive outlook on my academic performance. Did I do poorly on an exam recently? Yeah, but I just took the L and moved on, knowing I’ll be more prepared next time and everything will be ok. And look, everything is going to turn out ok for you too. So take care of your mental health, make sure you’re getting enough sleep, drink some water, and take a break from your homework every once in a while. It’s starting to cool down outside, so go for a walk (but wear a mask goddammit). When you take care of yourself first, everything will start to fall into place. It’s all about balance

Edit: Thanks to everyone for sharing and being so positive in the comments! In the spirit of sharing, I would like to expose the 50 I got on my first physics 1 exam, and the 40 I got on my first MatLab exam. I ended up passing both classes and I’m proud of my performance",2020-09-23 10:40:40

GT Housing and its treatment of its employees and residents has gone downhill for the past 4 years I've been here. We are belittled, disrespected, and gaslit by our Hall Directors, Area Managers, and other professional staff. None of our concerns are ever listened to, and there is no stability in the department overall. The few times we ask for support from them, we're ignored or pushed aside.

The emotional toll that it takes to be an SSM is insane, and we aren't provided proper support when dealing with it. The number of cases of sexual assault, depression, homesickness, coming out, break ups, break downs, roommate conflicts, and just general bad days that I've seen myself and my fellow RAs/PLs go through on nearly a daily basis is unparalleled to any other department except for Counseling. The only problem is, we aren't trained or compensated fairly for this kind of work. We are pretty much volunteer triage counselors, and it takes a fucking toll when you add in your other clubs, jobs, classes, and personal issues.

Not only this, but they have the audacity to remove half of the PL positions across campus, leaving one PL per floor to deal with double the residents, duty shifts, and general bullshit on their own. The ""additional"" compensation they're providing for double the work is a joke, and they're even banning SSMs from having any kind of other job on-campus or off-campus unless it's research.

I have loved this position like no other for the past 4 years, but I can't let this malpractice go unnoticed for any longer. If you're applying to become an SSM or considering returning to the position, please reconsider. **It isn't worth it. Period.** Putting in a decent number of hours a week at a part time job you enjoy would pay about the same while avoiding the stress and anger that we go through on a daily basis. The only way that anyone in Housing will ever listen to these issues is if they're starved of candidates and can't function, so please join in this good fight and spread the word.

Together, maybe we can move on from this era of shitty maintenance, overpriced housing, and staff neglect.",2020-02-17 21:12:24

Am I the Asshole for eating in my first college class?,381,ct3prl,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/ct3prl/am_i_the_asshole_for_eating_in_my_first_college/,32,1566354807,"I had my first 8 am today, and like many others I'm sure, I didn't have a chance to eat breakfast before going. Most professors are fine with eating in class, but apparently not all. It was the first day and my professor threw me out of class!

 I needed my daily does of protein for an early semester buzz (get it? Buzz). I made sure to sit in the middle of the classroom to have access to an outlet. I plugged in my hotplate and poured my buttermilk pancake mix on the hotplate (low fat of course). The professor didn't notice this but the looks from my classmates around me were scathing! I was going to try and make friends by giving away any leftover pancakes, but not anymore! As I was flipping the pancakes I figures I would start frying some of my bacon; I kindly requested that the person sitting next to me unplug their laptop. They refused! Luckily, my back up hotplate had an extra long cord since I've run into similar scenairios in the past (the nerve of some people!).


As my bacon started to sizzle, (my pancakes were already  a crisp buttery brown in case you were wondering) the professor stopped his lecture, scrunched his eyebrows, and looked around the classroom. His eyes drifted for a bit and then narrowed on me! 


""What exactly are you doing?""


 I politely replied, ""Why, I'm cooking breakfast, the most important meal of the day after all!""


His face reddened and he actually stammered a little, 


""Wh- Wh- What the hell do you think you're doing? Get out of my classroom!"" 


I was shocked, incredulous, aghast! I tried to reason with the man,


""It's almost finished! If you like, I can offer you a strip or two of my bacon!""


He stood his ground, and began to physically shake, 


""I want you out of my classroom, NOW!""


I reasoned his demand was a charade, and he would change his mind once I gave him my culinary specialty.


Undeterred, I unplugged my pancake hotplate and plugged in my blender. The professor started to shout, but I drowned him out as I threw my pancakes, bacon, and milk into the blender for my daily protein shake. He sprinted up the aisle towards me and I could tell I may have misread his intentions (slightly)! I unplugged my other hotplate and blender and hurried out of the class, chased all the while by the professor. 


Anyways, I'm not the asshole right? The professor clearly overreacted. I would not recommend Professor Mohammed if you have to take him next semester.",2019-08-20 22:33:27

Ain’t it crazy how much college changes u,374,is5t8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/is5t8s/aint_it_crazy_how_much_college_changes_u/,51,1600056988,"Just a little reflective post for my fellow yackets. Honestly this applies to everyone from freshman to those graduating (that’s me in December). 

These are all about me and opinionated, I feel like some resonate w it tho so I’m just putting this out there for sentimentality or smt

comment the biggest way u changed (so far since the start of college) below

1) told myself I would never drink alc LMFAO, I started drinking at 18 in college sort of because of wanting to be doing the same stuff as my friends and also out of curiosity. What I found was that alcohol is a very cheap and affordable way to have fun, but is best consumed in the presence of trusted individuals and is best w a small group of the real homies.

2) used to be a morning person in hs, college turned me into a crackhead night owl for 1-2nd years. Now I’m in the good place tho where I sleep at 12-3am depending on the day. 

3) in high school I was so motivated to just overindulge in extracurriculars but now I know what I really love, what to prioritize in my life, and that life is about following ur passions but also keeping ur responsibilities in line

4) taught me how to ask for help from peers. Hs was pretty cake for me (no flex, just how it was ig) but some classes on college bitch slapped me across the fucking face. However I went to office hours one day in freshman year and it honestly changed my life. The TA was so helpful and knowledgeable and as a peer, was able to better relate to what I was thinking and made the topic make way more sense. Since then I go to offic hours with confidence and it’s lit. Respect to the TAs, especially my 1554 TA, he kept it real and got donuts for us too, fucking legend. 

5) I became super emotionally aware/mature because u go thru a lot in college. Breakups, death of a friend, bomb a test, argument w a friend, wild stuff. I also learned that relationships don’t mean too much in college, we are between 17-23 on average here and like u might have dated from anywhere to 3 months to 3 years, but don’t be pressured to stay in a relationship that isn’t conducive to ur life as a person and student also. I know people in relationships who are like stable at best and keep it for the sake of being in a relationship, but someone who doesn’t get u or u need to compromise yourself for should be dropped. I found that college is where I found out how to be more expressive because my Chinese household wasn’t a place I could even speak my mind. If ur dating or friends w someone who caps ur individuality or has gotten one too many chances, cancel them because u can do better.

6) used to be a tea person and I now I drink black coffee w nothing in it and it tastes like nothing

7) I got involved w random stuff I never would have done in hs like clubs i didn’t even think seemed cool or made friends w people that gave of that wack vibe but I realized that I’m equally wack and it’s lit. 

8) I’m now a fiend at catan, I dominate that bitch like I did ur mom last night, jkjkjk

9) never thought I would code in college, now imma cs major who’s had two google internships and one for apple xD

10) learned to not two flying fucks about another persons negative AND unconstructive criticism of me. This means people who randomly hate or are toxic for the sake of it, I love being constructively criticized because it shows me what I can do better, but people who inherently don’t like me i could care less about. I’m also way more confident, a highlight would be when I walked into a sweethut (not midtown’s), did the middle portion of the chika dance, bowed, and walked off

Overall, be crazy, full send, don’t hinder urself because others are trying to box u, college is about learning yourself, having fun, but being responsible and goal oriented as well. The mix of those things is probably the most conducive to having a good time here.",2020-09-14 00:16:28

Unpopular Opinion: You should not be allowed to be a TA if you can barely speak English,369,d5ap4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/d5ap4t/unpopular_opinion_you_should_not_be_allowed_to_be/,83,1568715961,"I have a feeling this is going to be unpopular for not being “inclusive” so I decided to make an alt for this one.

I think that the most basic TA requirement is that you should be able to understand/speak English well. I’m tired of being in a lab and having to ask the same question 8 times to get an answer because the TA can’t understand what I’m saying.  It wastes tons of time and I end up getting the wrong information from the TA all the time since they will just guess what I am asking and provide a response. On a lab that takes the entire 2:45 class, time is precious.

Also, even if they do understand what I am saying, half of the time understanding their response is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Yes they are technically answering the question, but I have to uncomfortably ask them to repeat themselves several times (which visually annoys them) because whatever they said was only half English under a very thick accent.

All prospective TAs should sit down with someone and not be allowed to if their accent is too thick to be understood, they can hardly understand English, or they can’t provide clear responses in English.

I know I am not the only one who has had this frustration in many classes.  I’m aware that we have a lot of international graduate and undergrad students who are extremely capable people way smarter than myself, I just don’t thing those who just barely speak English should be allowed to TA for the betterment of all other students. Feel free to leave a comment to disagree or agree, I don’t care, I’m just venting.",2019-09-17 06:26:01

What GT does when you have a mental breakdown.,367,d3m8jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/d3m8jx/what_gt_does_when_you_have_a_mental_breakdown/,42,1568392177,"First off, I don’t want to scare anyone away from help.  Get help, but avoid campus resources for now.  You do not want them involved in your mental health;  find a private counselor, a good friend, a professor, or if you’re feeling worse than all of that:  Take an Uber to the hospital (PM me and I’ll even pay for the uber)

That having been said, here’s what you can expect if you let GT get involved:

In early spring ‘18, I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and I called the “counselor on call” at Georgia Tech.  I told them my situation and they *offered* a ride to Ridgeview institute.  I accepted, as an uber would have been expensive.  I could have said no and went home, meaning I was not an involuntary transport.  GTPD was chill and understanding, and we had good conversation on the way over.  But my mistake was that the GT bureaucracy was now involved.

My time at ridgeview was acceptable, and is not my main concern.  I worked honestly and exerted  effort with professionals I felt could make my mental health improve.  I was discharged 5 days later.  In my discharge paper, there was an exclusionary option for release of records; I filled it in with a few substances I was or had been on.  I signed the records to be sent to the GT counseling department, because I was told they’d want to do their own evaluation.

Upon my return, I was mandated to return to the dean of students before I could even attend class or return to a dorm.  Even before I could see the counselor I was required to see.  I set a meeting and the next day I arrived and she had in front of her my entire discharge manual.  This person, who had no medical or counselor training had my blood pressure, medicines, therapy notes, dietary observations, *and* the list of drugs I specifically prohibited to be on *ANY* discharge paper.

Her first words were “you need to get off of the xxxxx if you want to stay here.”  No “glad you’re better” “I hope you’re Ok.”

She asked me if I considered a retroactive withdrawal (withdrawing unconditionally from all classes for the semester), but I had professors who were willing to work with me over the coming summer to clean up the work I had missed.

I still don’t know where my discharge records are.  I missed the 180 day deadline to file a complaint to the HIPPA officials, so I guess I’ll never know.

tl;dr needed help, contacted GT, took their advice, got better, signed exclusionary discharge forms to counselors office, entire booklet ends up at dean of students’.",2019-09-13 12:29:37

A Firsthand Account of What GT Mental Health Services Are Really Like (Long Post),372,dewve3,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/dewve3/a_firsthand_account_of_what_gt_mental_health/,35,1570550166,"So, this happened to me last year. Some people who know me already know this story and, no, this account is not a throwaway. I figured people should hear my story from me directly. 

I’m a second year at Tech, and right off the bat, my first year started off poorly. A lot of factors were at play, but perhaps the most notable is the fact that I had untreated Depression and Anxiety (and as I’d later find out, OCD and ASD). 


FIRST HOSPITALIZATION:

About a week after my 18th birthday, I set out pills to take with the intention of ending my life. I was so lonely, so hopeless, and overwhelmed in every aspect of my life. However, I started imagining what would happen if I took the pills, panicked, and called the counseling center instead. After telling them what was happening, I was told to come to their office in the flag building. I Ubered there as I was a mess and didn’t want to be seen on the bus. I didn’t pack anything except a favorite ring of mine, and my dad’s jacket that he passed down to me. 

When I got to the counseling center, I’d say it was maybe a 20 minute wait before I was called back into one of the therapists’ offices. A lady took notes as she asked me what was happening, and then she told me what a 10-13 was. Now, for you fortunate folks who *don’t* know, this is when you are involuntarily checked in to a mental health facility for a minimum of 72 hours and must be escorted to said facility (in my case, by GTPD in a squad car). Remember this for later. 

I panicked. I didn’t want my parents to know what had happened. I knew they’d be so upset with me. I begged the therapist not to make me go. I didn’t want to miss class, I felt like I was already behind! I didn’t have any extra clothes or possessions to take with me! 

I didn’t have a choice. I was sent off to Ridgeview in Smyrna, where I stayed for either 4-5 days (to be honest, I’ve tried to repress the memories of my time there so I don’t remember exactly how long it was).

It was awful. The staff as apathetic, we had to turn in everything (including my dad’s jacket and my ring), we couldn’t have any devices (which I somewhat understand, but since music is what calms me down most, this sucked), the group sessions were more traumatic than helpful, the food was awful, and I felt even worse than I had before. I remember on my first night that I was snapped at and sent to sit out in the hall for crying in my bed. 

Finally, I was given a prescription for a low dosage of Prozac and released. When I got back to campus, I had a couple hundred pages of reading, assignments, tests, and more to make up. Though the Dean of Students office was great about helping me arrange makeup work (Dean Riggle deserves tons of praise here), I still knew that missing so much class would hurt me. I don’t learn from reading textbooks. I learn from hearing lectures and demonstrations. 

SECOND HOSPITALIZATION:

It wasn’t long before I noticed that my medication didn’t seem to be working. I fell back into my depressive habits. I wasn’t sleeping, wasn’t eating, couldn’t get myself out of bed, and “those thoughts” started coming back. 

One night, a month after my first hospitalization, I was studying for a big test. I had missed multiple lectures in this class while I was gone and from physically not being able to get myself out of bed to go to class. I realized I felt completely unprepared, panicked, and felt so trapped that I could only see death as a way to get out of the situation. I tried to hang myself, but the attempt failed. 

My roommate heard me crying in my room (apartment style dorm). She didn’t know I had attempted, but she texted me and recommended that I go talk to the Sports Psychologist the next day. I did. With only the clothes on my back and my backpack, I went to their office. Apparently, they had already spoken to my roommate, and knew that I had been upset. They asked if I had been suicidal again. I tried not to panic. I knew what would happen if I told the truth. I’d be shipped away again, I’d get the same terrible treatment, I’d feel even worse again. I refused to answer the question. 

They told me that since they had concern about me hurting myself, I would need to go to a facility. However, I was assured that I could go get evaluated voluntarily and be driven by my coaches instead of the police. I agreed to this. A few minutes later, I’m suddenly told that, no, that’s actually not what’s happening, I’m being 10-13’d again. I ask, “Doesn’t that mean a mandatory 72 hours?” I’m told that no, it doesn’t. Everything is the same, I’ll just have to have the GTPD escort me again. 

I’m hesitant, but I don’t really have a choice. I’m led through the tunnels of Bobby Dodd and put into yet another squad car. This time I’m taken to Peachford in Dunwoody. I wait for about two hours until I’m called back to be evaluated. This is when I find out that I was, in fact, correct. Despite being previously told by Sports Psychology that I would not have to stay 72 hours, Peachford informs me that this is exactly what I will be doing. 

I break down in the evaluation room. I literally felt like I had been taken prisoner. My anxiety attack was so severe that the staff threatened to take me to the stabilization unit if I didn’t calm down. I wasn’t violent. I was scared. Imagine just thinking you’re going on a trip to the doctor and you’re suddenly told that you’re to be locked in an institution and aren’t allowed to leave or have any of your things, including a change of clothes, for days. 

It was like an actual nightmare. Thankfully, Peachford wasn’t quite as bad as Ridgeview. It was still bad, but the staff at least seemed less cruel, and the food was pretty good compared to the Ridgeview prison slop. One of the times that I got to use the pay phone, I called the Sports Psychologist and asked why I’d been given misleading information. I reminded them that I had explicitly asked if a 10-13 would be 72 hours and was told no. They told me that “Well, it’s supposed to be 72 hours, yes, but a doctor *could* release you early.” I asked the doctor about this, and was told that no doctor would ever do that, because a 10-13 was always 72 hours. I felt very lied to and betrayed. 

When I was released again, I decided that maybe some of my stress could be alleviated if I dropped a class. On top of this, I had mandatory therapy and psychiatry appointments. However, on a particularly rough day, I found myself needing counseling when I didn’t have a therapy appointment scheduled. I dropped by the counseling center instead. I was led down the hall of roaring white noise machines (which I personally dislike) and into a therapist’s office. I told her about what had happened, and how I felt overwhelmed with stress again. I was still struggling to sleep, and had been bouncing around on different prescriptions to see what actually worked, which was taking a physical toll. 

She looked at me and shrugged. 
“What do you want *me* to do about it?” 
I stared at her. 
“Pardon?”

I know this is a long post with details that probably nobody cares about. I’ve just been needing to get this off my chest. It wasn’t linear progress for me from there by any means. Lately, things have become overwhelming again, and I often feel very alone. I want to make friends, but feel like I’m more of an annoyance to people than a potential a friend. 

It hurts my heart every time I hear or read that GT loses another student. I know I don’t have all the answers to fixing the glaringly obvious issues surrounding mental health care at Tech, but I can say with absolute certainty that things will never improve if the attitude towards the issue is a shrug and a “What do you want *me* to do about it?” 

Maybe it’s up to us students. We need and deserve for this to be fixed. I’d like to encourage everyone to try to remind someone that they matter in a *personal way.* Also, some of you are already pretty good about this, but I think we should all be more open about talking seriously about our own mental health. I know with the good ol’ Gen Z humor it’s easy to just make memes about having depression, but if we all fight the stigma just a little bit with honest conversation and being willing listeners, I think it could make a world of impact. 

Some mental health days and more student-professor communication about mental health could also potentially do a world of good. 

If nothing else is fixing this, I guess it’s up to us.",2019-10-08 11:56:06

I know GT housing has been getting a lot of flack, so I think it is time to give them some thanks.

Thank you for pushing us off of campus and then inviting us to come back soon, we know you want to see us! 

Thank you for allowing for a swift move out time that’s within the next 24 hours even though I live over 1000 miles away! 

Thank you for encouraging me to get out and travel, even though health officials are being party killers and telling me that I could get “sick.” 

Thank you for bringing together a community against the inefficiencies and overarching failures of an organization that can’t make up its mind (yes I know that USG is somewhat to blame). 

Thank you for getting me out of a mold filled and borderline collapsing room in the middle of Atlanta and ripping me away from most of my best friends. 

Thank you for absolutely cucking me and everyone that I know! 

Thank you for making my GT experience what it is.

I know that GT is under a lot of pressure and differing guidance from the many people who supersede its authority. BUT, holy crap, how can y’all be so disconnected from the people you’re supposed to help. The amount of cuckery that y’all have imposed on us is just absurd. If nothing else, I hope the people that GT currently hires realize that they need to learn from this situation and actually create plans that can be readily distributed and implemented in the event of unforeseen circumstances like those that we are currently facing. Change, and make sure you change for the better GT.

I cannot imagine what ya'll are going through right now. My freshman year was a really great experience for me socially and having to navigate that while under constant fear of being exposed to COVID-19 sounds genuinely traumatic. 

My life lately has led me to realize that we need each other now more than ever. Without some awesome friends here at tech I think I would be a miserable wreck right now. I think the only way we all get better is through practicing a radical empathy in everything we do. It is so, so important to be there for each other and understand that almost everyone is suffering now to some degree. No one is living their best life right now. This shit is miserable. 

So if anyone feels like they have no one to talk to now and needs to let something out, I would love to talk to you. My DMs are open. And reach out to all your old friends that you haven't talked to in forever! Now is a great time to reconnect. We all need eachother now.

1. [GATech CARE Center](https://care.gatech.edu/) - This is the first-line response and your first resource for any type of counseling.  Please note that due to Covid-19 they are in appointment mode instead of walk-in mode, so call the number of the front page if you want to schedule an appointment.
2. [Georgia Crisis and Access Line](https://www.georgiacollaborative.com/providers/georgia-crisis-and-access-line-gcal/) - (1-800-715-4225) This is a 24-hour phone number you can call at any time to talk to someone who will listen to you.
3. [Academic Coaching](http://success.gatech.edu/academic-coaching) - If you're feeling anxious about your classes, or your academic performance here at Tech, the Office of Undergraduate Education provides academic coaching by appointment for any undergraduate student.  These are trained professionals who can help you navigate the complexities of succeeding in college.  We're not counselors (that's not our role), but often working through academic barriers can ease the mind quite a bit.
4. [GradesFirst](https://gatech.gradesfirst.com/) - This is the Institute-wide scheduling site for meeting with your advisor.  Feel free to schedule a meeting at any time to talk about your program or to ask for advice.

To all the people who have DMed me so far, thank you so much for reaching out! It's worth it if I've made any one of your days slightly better. 

And just remember: it will get better! Coronavirus will end one day. Whatever stress or anxiety you're feeling will pass. Even if it seems like everything is only getting worse now. I genuinely believe every single one of you are capable of fantastic things and I want you all to succeed with my whole heart. And I am here for you. :)",2020-08-25 07:57:18

Why is scout the face of the new campus initiatives?,357,72m3us,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/72m3us/why_is_scout_the_face_of_the_new_campus/,95,1506477150,"Long post, sorry.



While Scout was a victim of their mental illness, they were not a victim of the events that led to their death. Scout committed suicide via cop, which meant creating a situation where the cop was forced to shoot. If the cop didn't take the shot then, Scout would have continued to approach and presumably stab the officer. Just visualize the world where that happened instead of the officer taking the shot that he did.



Given the way these events played out, why is it that Scout is the face of PSA's demands? That the new LGBTQIA+ club room is named in their honor? Scout may have been a victim of their mental illness, but the way they went out was not the way of a victim. It makes me uncomfortable that we're going to pretend that Scout was wholly innocent that night.



Suicide obviously isn't a light topic, but as a suicide survivor myself, this whole situation is incredibly uncomfortable. We're glorifying the actions of a student that forced another to take their life, destroying the lives of two people in the process. I'm not trying to say that the officer suffered equally to Scout, but Scout's actions were selfish. Scout unfairly turned another human being into a villain, drove their Antifa comrades to attack other officers just a couple nights later, and the saddest thing is that Scout took something away from every single person that their life may have touched. Scout caused so much pain to their own friends and family by unfairly taking their own life.



Suicide is not something to be glorified, it is a tragedy. Maybe it's easy for me to distance myself from Scout's death since I didn't know them. Maybe I don't understand the struggles of LGBTQIA+ people because I'm a straight white male. Maybe I don't understand mental illness because my own is worthless due to my privilege. Despite all of this, I implore the Georgia Tech community to take a hard look at who Scout was on that night and choose to not honor the person that almost stabbed a police officer and then posthumously incited a riot. Instead honor the Scout that was a community leader, a mentor, and a friend. Honor Scout's memory by not creating a divide between those who are part of the LGBTQIA+ community and those who aren't. Please work to build bridges between those who don't quite understand each other yet.



We are one Georgia Tech.

Another reason to like GT Dining,344,a0bs7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/a0bs7r/another_reason_to_like_gt_dining/,16,1543204922,"(https://i.imgur.com/jD5a0eJ.jpg)
I compiled all the places I saw that said North Ave would be open today into this picture of a deserted North Ave. Maybe there was an announcement somewhere that said it'd be closed today, but I missed it, and I'm definitely not the only one who did.

Over the course of the past hour or so that I've been working on homework in here, I've seen around 10-20 people walk through the unlocked doors, wonder why there was no cashier stationed, then see that there's no food being made & turn around disappointed. Many of them probably walked all the way from west like me (no buses that I've ever seen run on weekends are tracked on the app), and will have to walk back hungry due to having been misinformed.

If dining services can't pick a schedule (which was posted in 2 sites and a mass email) and stick to it, I think that's pretty damned sorry.

But if there was a subtle 4th announcement that I missed that overrides the other 3 resources that I and several other students use, I am truly sorry. I'm not trying to embarrass GT Dining more than it has already embarrassed itself in the past and present in a multitude of other ways.

Edit: Employees came in, but not to make food, apparently. They forced me to stop studying and leave (""It's not open"") and stood at the door to send more hungry students back home, disappointed. Shame they kicked me out, I wanted to mooch off their soda and electricity for longer since they led us all on without remorse and still have not changed any posted scheduling, even after the continued influx of students.

ATTENTION UPPERCLASSMEN: normalize calling out non-mask-wearing students,331,i7jt1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/i7jt1k/attention_upperclassmen_normalize_calling_out/,45,1597143579,"A different kind of post. No I'm not just ranting about these freshmen who aren't wearing masks. No, I'm not just posting a picture and complaining.

I am calling for all students to normalize calling out others who aren't wearing masks and telling them to put one on.

POV, I'm one of your fellow RAs and am stunned with the lack of caution. The vibe that I'm sensing from freshmen right now, is that they don't think they will get covid, or they don't care if school/campus closes. HOWEVER AS UPPERCLASSMEN WE UNDERSTAND THE CHAOS OF EVACUATING CAMPUS AND MOVING ONLINE and we do not want to go through this again. The GT Housing train-wreck. The GT Admin flailing like a fish out of water.

I have a close friend and she's been active in calling out freshmen in the quad, waiting in line for food, in the dorms, etc to put on a mask. I am not a very confrontational person, but I have started being vocal about it too. Yeah, they will stare back daggers at me, but I'll see a few people around me make  some eye-contact or give a head-nod of approval. Even the most quiet, passive person can play a role in changing campus culture.

I hope when upperclassmen move in, we will change the campus culture and hold each other accountable for wearing masks and socially distancing.

Edit: It's not about shaming or making you feel bad. If anything...I don't really care about you're feelings. It's about wanting to protect myself, other students, and our campus. If you are surrounded by people wearing masks (ie. standing in line at Britain) and you are holding your mask in your hand, I will tell you to put it on. ",2020-08-11 06:59:39

Jay Cole was wrong.,333,axnvp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/axnvp8/jay_cole_was_wrong/,27,1551836555,"In the hit song ""A Lot"" by popular British rapper 21 Savage, the North Carolina rapper J Cole makes the following claim  ""Some n\*ggas make millions, other n\*ggas make memes ."" It is my belief that Mr. Cole made a mistake by juxtaposing these two professions. He implies that these two careers are mutually exclusive, but I believe there is a certain people group who reside in both of these categories.

&#x200B;

The Georgia Institute of Technology, also known as Georgia Tech, is a public research university and institute of technology located in Atlanta, Georgia. It is part of the University System of Georgia and has satellite campuses in Savannah, Georgia; Metz, France; Athlone, Ireland; Shenzhen, China; and Singapore. The median starting salary for a Georgia Tech graduate is $70,500 ([https://www.academiceffectiveness.gatech.edu/2018/08/20/spring-2018-career-and-salary-data-now-available/](https://www.academiceffectiveness.gatech.edu/2018/08/20/spring-2018-career-and-salary-data-now-available/)) and Georgia Tech ranks as one of the top 100 universities for producing millionaires ([https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/worlds-top-100-universities-for-producing-millionaires/2008749.article](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/worlds-top-100-universities-for-producing-millionaires/2008749.article)).

&#x200B;

Georgia Tech graduates, in addition to having a relatively high chance of becoming a millionaire, also have a high chance of making memes. With meme platforms such as the Facebook page ""GT Memes for Buzzed Teens"" and the popular subreddit /r/gatech, a non-negligible amount of the Georgia Tech student body has made at least one meme in their lifetime. Due to these probabilities, it is reasonable to assume there exists a subset of Georgia Tech graduates who are millionaires and have made at least one meme, thus disproving Mr. Cole's assumption that meme making and wealth measured in millions are mutually exclusive.",2019-03-05 20:42:35

[Serious] Can we address some behavior issues on this sub?,328,ccpr1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/ccpr1g/serious_can_we_address_some_behavior_issues_on/,42,1563055864,"Hello everyone, just wanted to post a quick opinion that may not be reflective of the majority of subscribers to this sub, but I believe is still worth sharing.           

As a community, I have noticed we have started becoming rather toxic towards people asking for help this past year or two. New students have their questions downvoted to the shadow realm, and I actually just saw a parent's question receive snarky responses instead of actual answers - totally unwarranted.         

Put yourself in these guys' shoes: we have new freshmen and/or concerned parents that are curious as to certain aspects of GT and are not sure how they work. Therefore, they decide to ask for help/advice on one of the largest (if not the largest) online communities available for GT. And instead of receiving help, they are essentially told their question isn't worth our precious time. Seriously, what kind of a message does that send to these kids and their parents?        

Now I need to pause for a moment here and note a few things. First off, most of the posts end up receiving help in the end, regardless of if they are downvoted or not, so kudos to most of you guys. Secondly, you are right: 99% of the questions submitted have been asked beforehand and have most likely been answered as well. I totally understand how frustrating it is to see ""What LLC is right for me?"" for the 15th time in one day.         

However, regardless of how annoying these posts are, these people are still asking for help and advice. If their question has already been answered then simply tell them! If you have the time, maybe link them to the original question. Just don't mock them. Even if someone else answers their post, your hostile comment still makes them feel very unwelcome. You don't have to be a dick to correct someone...        

Alright that's all for now folks. Hopefully some of you feel the same.

What self-proclaimed yellow jacket fan would want third down in Bobby Dodd to be quieter? I don’t even care about Money Down or whatever they play on the loudspeakers, MONEY DOWN AND THIRD DOWN CHORDS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. That you have a volunteer organization of the loudest and biggest Georgia Tech fans in a prime section of the stadium, and then tell them to be quiet when the opposing offense converts third down after third down is idiotic. 


Having the band play chords on defensive third downs is what gets the fans in the entire stadium loud as well. When you have the people who practice hours every week to be as loud as they can silenced on GAMEDAY, you lose half of the volume and 100% of the atmosphere of college football in Bobby Dodd Stadium. Georgia Tech Fans were louder and more excited at the away game in Clemson (where we lost worse than the spread) than they have been for the past two HOME games. I was there for both, and the biggest reason why is because the band could play as loud as they wanted at an away game and can’t in their own stadium.


If you don’t want to hear the band support the atmosphere of college football at your home games, then you might as well stop funding them all together and replace them with the PA system. Go ahead and see if that will fill your North Stands when the football team loses to Citadel. If you’re going to fund a band, let them play often and loud. 


Third down chords are one of the band’s greatest traditions, and we better start recognizing what we had before it’s gone. Losing my ears and my vocal chords on defensive third downs is as much a part of the Yellow Jacket experience as dancing to Bud and the Horse. Honestly chords should be a part of T night every year.",2019-09-15 01:18:12

It's currently in beta and we'd love your review of a recent internship as we try to get over 100 reviews before the InVenture prize (which we're competing in!).

It's 2020 and we can go on Amazon and find a thousand reviews on a $10 soap dispenser, but can't find a single review for internships that may effect our entire careers... Why?

We discovered this problem last year and found that **you simply cannot find internship reviews** despite the hundreds of thousands of interns hosted in the US every summer. There's just no central source like there is for everything else: product reviews, professor reviews, doctor reviews, restaurant reviews, etc.

The end-goal of the platform is to provide an experience where you can plug in all the specific tools or skills that you want to use/ improve at your internship (Ex. C/C++, VHDL, Eagle CAD) and Canary will return a list of all the internships **where students actually did those things, not just  job postings that** ***say*** **you will.**

C2D2 tries to collect this information, as you know if you've ever filled out their survey at the end of an internship, but **they're not allowed to share it because of FERPA.** There's probably dozens of reviews about a position you're applying for right now that you can't access.

We don't take ourselves too seriously, so feel free to ask questions below or DM me!

Kemp started up digital learning and he said, ""I'll start this show""

**If lettergrade=TRUE:**

**HOPE=0**

**Elif PASSFAIL==TRUE:**

**Else:**

Hopefully, eventually someone in administration can see the concerns of the students. While the storm is just missing Atlanta(at best), 30% of students are commuters and at least 10% drive here from south of Atlanta. Many have a 45 minute-1 hour drive from the South, so how are they supposed to drive through up to 5 inches of rain to get here tomorrow. Imagine all the car wrecks on the highway and the huge amount of rain itself will be a complete chaos. What if even one student or faculty gets into a car wreck. How would we look to others as a school, we couldn't cancel one day of class to help the safety of our own faculty and students. I know canceling a day is detrimental to the institution and to some level the students, but looking at the bigger picture at the end of the day safety should be the number 1 concern. With all due respect to administration please cancel school tomorrow.

UPVOTE for awareness.

Classes are difficult, stress builds exponentially, and yet Georgia Tech is far and away my favorite place on the planet. I remember my first week on campus and realizing that for the first time in my entire life, I was completely surrounded by people my own age that inspired me to grow and learn. You guys are the most amazing, talented, driven group of people I have ever met. We are the one of the most unique schools on the planet - a hybrid of sorts. We have all the wonderful perks of a state school: rich culture and history, deep connections with our hometown and state, sports and fans, a large alumni pool of absolute badasses, etc. However, we also have the academics to rival any STEM school on the planet - and rival them we do. In every single endeavor we take, I feel like GT students attack problems with this level of ferocity I just haven't seen at any other school. Maybe it is because deep down, every one of us has something to prove to the world, maybe it is because our culture encourages this level of performance; I don't know: but I love it and I miss it.         

I know this might be a little bit of a rose-tinted view of GT, and sure there are things that objectively suck here. Dining is ass, dorms are ass, classwork is ass, USG is omega ass, CS majors straight up smell like ass... But overall, I think Georgia Tech is exceptional - mainly because of you guys, the people I am proud to call classmates.          

.          

This semester is unprecedented in our school's history. However, never forget that Georgia Tech is built on struggle. Every student who has ever graduated has faced trials just as intense. But we have to keep pushing onward, together.        

**""To say Georgia Tech is a hard school is an understatement. It will be harder than anything you have ever done in your life. And the worst part? No one will understand what you are going through. No one, that is, except for your fellow jackets. Keep them close, and aid them when you are able: especially those too proud or shy to ask for help.""** - an alum's words of advice after I decided to commit to GT.        

So that is what I ask of each of you: don't give up, not with one month left until finals. Help each other, study hard, and finish this semester strong. Reach out to professors, they understand first hand what you are going through. But don't give up.",2020-04-07 11:08:01

The thought of going back in the fall (where let’s be honest, a COVID outbreak is just waiting to happen on a campus of 15k students, in the heart of a major city, even with masks mandatory) and potentially contracting coronavirus is really leading to some feelings of anxiety. 

Even if our age group is highly unlikely to die from it (I’m fully aware of course of how the risk to faculty is much higher than us), the potential long term effects of reduced lung capacity and lingering symptoms well after recovery is a little scary too. I’d like to still be able to work out for the first two weeks of each semester and then give up on it like normal, ya know. 

It’d be nice if we could go to full remote (or optional remote) so no one has to get infected (students, faculty and all) because they came back to campus, without having to withdraw for a semester and costing more $$ in the long run.

I'm Lost.,306,evz2gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/evz2gc/im_lost/,59,1580384321,"I'm feeling very lost and alone here at Tech. 

I was a good kid in high school, got mostly A's as school came easily to me and I didn't have to study or apply myself much, y'know, typical ""gifted student"" in elementary and ""overachiever"" in high school type scenario. If I struggled with something, I always thought it just wasn't for me. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since middle school, and I never had many friends in school to hang out with in the first place. Being an introvert, I usually isolated myself and never talked about my mental health with my parents or any of the few friends I had. I always thought that in college it will get better. I'll get away from past traumas and make new friends and have new experiences, and everything will get better. 

I got into Tech with an amazing scholarship that not many people get, and all I had to do was keep a 3.0. Seems easy, right? In the fall, I registered for 16 credits, coming in with a few from AP's. Six classes didn't seem like so much since I always took 7 in high school. Prior to classes starting, I attended FASET and Wreck Camp and got out of my introvert shell a bit, meeting new people and having some generally fun times. College was a new start for me, and I was interested in reinventing myself. However, being the introvert that I am, after faset and wreck camp, I didn't strive to keep the relationships that I had made, and everyone drifted away, making their own new friends. I became friends with my roommates, we would do fun stuff together occasionally on the weekends, but I didn't really make any other friends besides them. Going to classes and walking around campus seeing everyone hanging out and studying with their friend groups made me even more depressed, thinking that I wouldn't make any friends since everyone had already made their own friends. 

Throughout the semester, my depression and anxiety continued to get worse, building with my declining grades. I eventually lost all motivation to exist and get out of bed, no friends to fall back on or hold me accountable for anything. I felt so lost and lonely, even on a campus of over 30,000 students, I didn't feel at home at Tech or even like I belonged here in the first place. I tried getting help academically by attending plus sessions, TA hours, and culc tutoring, but nothing was seeming to work. I was completely overwhelmed by my six classes, not being able to fit enough hours of studying and existing in the day and also getting enough sleep to function. No motivation mixed with the absolute inability to focus on anything makes for a really bad time. 

I tried telling my parents that I needed mental help, but they kept denying that there was anything wrong with me mentally. ""Just change your attitude,"" ""You're too negative,"" ""Nothing's wrong with you, stop pitying yourself so much,"" etc. was common to hear any time I brought up mental health. Tech's mental health resources were of no help to me. They told me surface-level things that I could look up on the internet, like making friends and getting a hobby. I don't think they were even listening when I talked about my extreme social anxiety, based on those recommendations. I understand that they have a ton of students to deal with, but come on, you could at least be a little bit more personal with your patients. By the end of the semester, my mental health was worse than it ever had been, I barely studied at all for my finals, and all I wanted was a couple friends to reach out to and have fun with. The whole time, I knew I had to keep a 3.0, but all I wanted to do was pass my classes to get them over with. Nothing in my classes was interesting to me, and frankly I didn't care about them. 

Getting my final grades back totally crushed me. I failed calculus by barely two points, tanking my GPA to much below what is required to keep my scholarship. I was home for the holidays, and I don't think my family was ready for the massive anxiety attack I was about to have. I was a failure, I didn't deserve to live or even go to college anymore. If i couldn't even pass the first math class of my major, how was I even supposed to THINK about doing the rest of them? My winter break was absolutely ruined. I sat around in my room all day and isolated myself, wallowing in my own self-hatred and depression. Finally, my parents started to realize that I needed help. They helped me find a therapist in the area to see while I'm in school. I've seen them about three times, and I know it takes a while, but I don't know if it's even working. I'm so damaged to the point where I don't think anything will help except maybe strong medication.

Currently, I'm taking the next level of calculus even though I failed the first class, and I am having MAJOR test anxiety. I try to study, and I can't physically bring myself to focus on studying. Its near impossible. There are millions of thoughts on my mind constantly, drowning out me barely trying to read the practice problems. Nothing has changed since last semester, and I feel like I'll fall into the same spiral of bad grades and poor mental health. I still don't have any friends this semester, and that's honestly really all I want out of college. I think that having at least a few friends would make my existence suck a little less. This semester I feel like it's my last chance to prove that I deserve to be here and to not lose my scholarship, but I'm wasting it away by not studying when I know damn well that I should be. I've tried basically everything except studying with other people, half because of my crippling social anxiety of talking to others and half thinking I'm too stupid for anyone to want to study with me. High school didn't prepare me at all for college. I have horrible time management, zero study skills, and add my awful mental state on top of that. I don't want to fail again. I can't fail again. I really need help, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so lost here.

Sorry for venting, I thought it might be a good idea to reach out, y'all are better at this college thing than me.",2020-01-30 06:38:41

More Covid-19 Testing Details,302,ht4kay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/ht4kay/more_covid19_testing_details/,17,1595050889,"Hi everyone, me again. Sorry for the multiple posts in one day but I just got a lot more info after a meeting and wanted to keep y'all posted because it addresses a lot of the questions I was getting earlier. So first off keep in mind that not 100% of the logistics of this has been figured out, but I've gotten word that all of this was approved. This is gonna be a long one but bear with me.

So there are going to be three different types of testing options:

1. Stamps will have a rapid test (results in 15 min) for mainly just symptomatic people (if you are asymptomatic, you can still schedule an appointment, but it's going to depend on availability)
2. There will be 5000 test kits distributed per day. They're figuring out who will be in charge of distributing these. These will go to residence halls, Greek houses, classrooms, clubs, at stands around campus, even trying to get to off campus apartments, etc. These will be saliva test kits that you will do yourself, stick a bar code on the side, and then drop off in one of the many drop sites around campus (there will be one in every residence hall and just many around campus). Again, these will be optional, but they will be super easy. I believe there will then be a website that you can check for your results in the next 1-2 days. The idea with these is that they're testing in groups, so they'll test all of the groups at once, and then if someone in your group tests positive you will be notified and come in for a second, individual test. This should help with the accuracy of the test, and it will notify GT of any hotspots on campus. There also may be pop up stations around campus where you can seek out one of these saliva tests. The goal is for every student to receive a test kit once per week (so I guess they were asking about biweekly earlier because that is the current capacity and they're working up to every single week).
3. GT is working with Fulton county and they are going to set up a test site for the first 3 weeks that students are on campus

I hope that this clears up some of the questions from earlier, and I'm sure GT will be communicating this info once they clarify more logistics. Feel free to reach out with more questions but this is pretty much all I know at this time. Also, meal swipes will now be accepted at food trucks! How cool is that!",2020-07-18 01:41:29

Observations from an outsider,305,aev270,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/aev270/observations_from_an_outsider/,77,1547239794,"A slight preface, I'm a Study Abroad student coming here just for a fun, and perhaps academically rigorous, curriculum and research experience. It's not my place to say anything, but some things I’ve noticed have been infuriating me for days. What I’m about to say doesn't really affect me too much at all. After all, I will be gone in a short time, and I have easy access to alternatives. However, I still find it ridiculous and worth ranting on about and get more clarity on.

There’re compulsory fees everywhere. During a briefing for Study Abroad students, they even said that small fees are part of America's culture, as though they are proud of it. That's very off-putting. I find that something one should be ashamed of, not for one to proudly trot around with. If one cannot project fees properly, this meant that one might need to resort to more loans, or even abandon the endeavor for college education. This discourages fiscal responsibility and poses so many problems. Why, why, why is that the case? I'm seriously confused.

What's also concerning me are the barriers to college education, food, and housing that I see here.

First issue, books. I'm okay with instructors telling us that the book would be useful, and that one might be required to do one's own research to get the information needed for the course if we don't get the book. That's perfectly fine. With access to the internet, I'm quite sure a determined student will be able to do all that with some effort.

What's infuriating is instructors telling us that the book is 'required', and then using some obscure book's latest edition. It's hard to procure them from second-hand stores, or even get the books at any reasonable price. This seems to be a problem endemic in lower level courses, where book publishers seem to have a high propensity in influencing course requirements. Lower level courses are usually where the field has been the most developed, and where there are numerous widely, easily accessible decent alternatives the instructor can use. I'm quite sure it would easier to not change books if the underlying content doesn't change.

What's worse are situations where you need a unique access codes to do quizzes and exams. They are forcing you to sacrifice more than 20 days’ worth of meals just for a few short sessions of use. what the actual fuck.

This issue even appeared to be worsening. I've noticed for some classes, what once required only textbooks now require unique access codes that you have to buy. Usually, these classes are either compulsory or easy free electives, and most students seemed to just take this burden on without question.

For food, I could find filling, delicious food for less than 2 dollars back home. Here, to get anywhere near that taste, price, or nutrition, the only way would be to cook. Even then it's not likely, for the short amount of time I'm here, the cost of buying cooking equipment and ingredients will not be balanced out by the times I used them.

I’ve also noticed that they seemed to charge a premium for 'healthier' food here, when it is evident they put in less effort and use less ingredients for them. Being poor here meant it's hard to get the proper nutrition one needs, ain't it? I'm sure we all know how important food and nutrition is. Why is that the case?

I'm sure I don't need to say much about the dining hall qualities here. Imagine my shock when I saw an email telling me that athletes will have priority for food. THIS MEANS THAT THE FOOD SERVED WILL ALWAYS RUN OUT. People pay for their swipes only to find out they cannot redeem it? That's ridiculous. Even then, I've heard that food is not even sufficient or filling sometimes. Cooking even a simple meal would be that much more worth it, even with the time invested.

For housing, I would postpone my comment on that as I must rush for my classes now, with transport here being less than optimal.

I've always heard that student activism is strong here in America, and that students can and usually do enact change. Students here seemed to just accept this situation and do nothing much about it. Are these issues really not worth talking about? What has the SGA done about this issue?

From my perspective, I find that this situation affects the middle-income students the most. They are in a position where they are limited in their opportunities for subsidies and financial assistance and must fork out money from their own limited pocket for all these added fees.

Even for lower income students, this extra step will serve to deter them from college education. We already know how hard it is for them to enter colleges, and I'm heartened to see efforts to allow them to enroll in colleges but all these extra steps for additional funds takes time, and time is very precious opportunity cost.

What are the arguments for keeping these practices, and worsening it in fact?

I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but I really want to understand why and how this situation persists and perpetuated. I would not be surprised if this ends up buried, but I just want to get this out and possibly hear some conversations about them. Am I limited in my perspective? What am I not seeing here? I would be open to learning more if anyone cares to enlighten.

Thank you for reading till here, appreciate it.

That's partly the reason for the delay in editing this post, or not replying to any of the below replies at all. I want to minimise my interactions here as much as possible, but I am very clear that anyone who wants to know who I am will know. 

What I'm about to say will probably reveal much about where I'm from, but I will refrain from directly commenting on where exactly. 

To address the overall sentiment, I am in no way exaggerating about the price range of food. It is very possible where I'm from to get food at that price range if one knows where to look. but even as an outsider, it's possible to get it on campus at the price range from 2-3 USD. If I may add, the cost of living back home is comparable, or even higher than the states. I am content with cooking my own food here, but wished it would have been as convenient as it was back home.

I am by no means struggling now, but had intended to set aside a higher amount of allowance for my family. I am currently under a sponsorship that allows me to offset most of the cost of studying here. That's one of the reasons why I chose gatech. It has a good reputation and I would like to try out 'America', which would broaden my perspective, but the price is distracting. Academically and ranking wise, there's not much difference to gatech. I would contend that gatech has a larger faculty that caters to more varied interests but there's little difference in teaching style or instruction, contrary to what I expected.

I appreciate the view points everyone have given over here. I read about past examples of student activism back home, and was heartened by the passion that they have. I was hoping to see that over here, but it's not seems it's not likely given the trend. From what I understood, the market forces enable these situations, and it is very hard for things to change without organised effort (that is unlikely to happen). I would chuck these differences to culture and let it be. I missed much of what my home has to offer me, but am excited about the possible 

Moreover, OIT and GTPD have helped me out in several occasion, and I would like to commend them on their pro-activeness.",2019-01-11 15:49:54

Non-infected students should consider leaving campus NOW if they can quarantine and pursue studies at home,302,iix6fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/iix6fp/noninfected_students_should_consider_leaving/,88,1598753417,"Speaking strictly for myself, based on my reading of the situation as someone who has been following the situation closely, I think the time has come for non-infected students to leave campus and for almost all courses to revert to remote delivery. I have tremendous admiration for my colleagues who have stood up the excellent testing system, and like everyone else at GT I hope they can be successful in bringing the number of infected down to a steady state well below the current 4% level. But given the high infection rate in our state, the impending ordinary flu season, the LACK of MANDATORY TESTING and CONTACT TRACING, and the continuing challenge of preventing spread among young adults living in close proximity to one another, the best measure now would be to go fully remote. GT is not doing that for a number of reasons, and no one has identified a point at which we would revert to remote. (Elsewhere in the USG system the infection rate is in double digits and there is no useful asymptomatic testing and yet USG will not let those colleges go remote so there is no reason to believe we would be allowed to close no matter how dire the situation.)

The only reason for not going remote that is health-related is the fear that returning infected students to their homes and home communities will spread the disease and expose more vulnerable populations. Therefore, I would like to urge those students who are NOT symptomatic to test themselves first, and if they are NEGATIVE, to return home and voluntarily quarantine for 14 days to be sure they are not infected. This will protect those students from becoming infected and it will also be the best protection for their families of who will risk exposure to the virus if people wait to return home until the on-campus spread is worse or they are personally infected. Also, removing more students from campus will effectively isolate the infected students and arrest spread, and it will allow those students who truly need to be on campus to have a safer environment.

As a member of the faculty and an administrator I want to personally apologize for the fact that GT has been unable to mandate remote-only education, as the science has clearly indicated for months. But given that we find ourselves in this situation, as a matter of conscience, I feel obliged to urge those non-infected students who can comfortably pursue their studies at home to think seriously about getting out now before things get much worse.",2020-08-29 22:10:17

43 out of 50 Top-ranked Engineering Schools Move to P/F,297,frh7a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/frh7a4/43_out_of_50_topranked_engineering_schools_move/,95,1585558750,"**48 out of** [US News' top **50** undergraduate engineering programs](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/engineering-doctorate) have either moved to a blanket pass/fail option for Spring 2020 or have modified pass/fail policies to allow students to opt in. The 2 universities that have not modified their policies are: Tech (#4) and ASU (#39).

Not only is Tech being unfair and unaccommodating to students who have limited access to technology or are under exceptional financial stress, but they are disadvantaging *all* students who will  struggle with the transition to online classes and suffer hits to their GPA. By not giving the students the **option** to switch classes to pass-fail, as **98%** of their peer institutions have done, Tech is putting their current students and graduates at a competitive disadvantage against students from other top-ranking institutions and potentially damaging their internship or job prospects, or their chances at graduate school admission.

Edit: It's been brought to my attention that UIUC has moved to a pass-fail system, making the number of schools 44, not 43. If you have updates that any of the schools I mentioned have recently moved to a pass-fail system, please let me know and I'll update the post. All of schools not mentioned by name (aka the 44) have publicly published new grading policies permitting students to take classes P/F on their websites. The 6 I mentioned have not published updated policies that I could find.

If you're like me, you recently received an email of the itemized damages of your room after moveout. The Standard was obligated by law to give us this list no more than 3 days after moveout, for my case it has been 15 days. For this reason, we are obligated to our full deposits without any withholdings.

So I ask that you, if you had any of your security deposit withheld, respond to their itemized damage email with this template (or something similar if you'd like):

Hi, 


Georgia Law requires this itemized list be sent within 3 days of move out (pursuant to OCGA 44-7-33 section b). 


According to 44-7-35 section b: ""The failure of a landlord to provide each of the written statements within the time periods specified in Code Sections 44-7-33 and 44-7-34 shall work a forfeiture of all his rights to withhold any portion of the security deposit or to bring an action against the tenant for damages to the premises.""


For this reason, I request the entire deposit be returned to me. Otherwise, I will have to pursue payment in small claims court.


Have a good one,

YOUR NAME



UPDATE:

Just received an email this morning saying I will be receiving my entire deposit back. We did it boys. Fuck you The Standard.

But don't get complacent now. Now we wait and see if they pay out the deposits by August 31st. If not, they'll have a much more expensive legal threat looming.",2019-08-14 22:47:35

GT further hurts grad students with increases to student fees and mandatory health insurance costs,292,cmhrpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/cmhrpo/gt_further_hurts_grad_students_with_increases_to/,56,1565071571,"Georgia Tech has been steadily increasing student fees, originally created at $100/semester as a ""temporary measure"" in 2009 and have steadily risen to 10x that for the current fiscal year ($1,000/semester). Most graduate students are required to enroll full time spring, summer, and fall totaling student fees of ~$2700/yr. This is the fifth highest among all graduate schools in the country. That is ~9-18% of a grad student's income, depending on which department the grad students is in. Because these fees are not bundled into tuition waivers, they are still taxed for those fees even though they never actually see that money in their income. Additionally, the new student health insurance provider will increase our mandatory insurance costs by $1500/yr. On top of all of this, GT won't let other outside grants or funding cover student fees. Graduate students play a critical role in university systems. If you factor in cost of rent in Atlanta, food, utilities, and other mandatory expenses, it can become quite clear that the increase in student fees can be the make or break point for a grad student going into debt or not. Graduate students teach and grade courses, provide cheap research labor, and help to drive ingenuity (and therefore funding and prestige) for Georgia Tech. If GT doesn't do anything to fix this, by paying their grad students a competitive wage WITHOUT duplicitous fees, they will lose fantastic students to other universities. Cost is something every grad student looks at when comparing top tier grad schools. If they feel they'll go into (or further into) debt (after undergrad), they will choose to go elsewhere. This affects all of levels of GT: it affects GTA teaching quality, it affects institute research quality, and it affects grad student quality of life. And don't even get me started on how the on-campus, university-promoted, graduate student living center ISN'T EVEN AFFORDABLE ON GRAD STUDENT STIPENDS. I tried to avoid getting rant-y, but GT seems to genuinely be out of touch with their grad students and it's illegal for us to unionize, so I'll end here.",2019-08-06 02:06:11

The thing is, I didn't cheat. And I just got the report from OSI... he didn't have any evidence of cheating. The only argument he made was that I didn't show all of my work on a problem (skipping the algebra steps of an integral bc I did it in my head), so he assumed I must have used a calculator. There is no evidence of me using a calculator, and I didn't use a calculator, but I still got reported off of speculation.

I believe I will beat the OSI case, but these things take forever to resolve, and I'm worried that my professor will give me a 0 on the test and completely destroy my grade. 

I tried to email the professor and ask him what his plan was for my grade on the test because it would take a while for my case to be resolved. Instead of responding to my question, he insisted that I do not contact him about this incidenent.

So now I'm worried that I'm going to fail math. It's been a month since the test, but there still has been no progress on my case.  I feel like I got screwed by this professor. Is there a way for me to make a formal complaint agaisnt him without him knowing that I am involved? I think if he found out that I reported him, I would be screwed even worse.",2020-04-23 00:40:38

Stop lying and pretending you care about our safety! You only extended the deadline because the contract changed, not because of COVID. 

Georgia has 1,800 new cases a day and we still don’t even know which classes will be online, or if we’ll start off hybrid just to be sent back home after a month when enough of the student population is sick.

They don’t care about our petitions signed by thousands of students. It seems like they don’t listen to our student government. They aren’t confident following the actions of other state university systems.

Stingerette x Reader Fanfiction,288,8y64wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/8y64wx/stingerette_x_reader_fanfiction/,45,1531393720,"You sit on a bench, the Stingerette App open on your phone. A slight breeze rolls in as the sun begins to set. The time your watch ticks from 5:59pm to 6:00; the time has come. You put in the request. Your destination doesn’t matter to you, it’s more about the journey. 1 guest. No wheelchair needed. No optional comments. You hit “request ride” and anxiously await your driver assignment. Your heart drops. There are 2 stops ahead of you. The expected time of arrival is 11 minutes. You slump back in the bench as your heart races. Every passing second feels like an eternity. You open snapchat, check your hair, your teeth, everything has to be perfect. You’ve paid thousands of dollars in tuition for this one moment.

You open the app again; 9 minutes to arrival, one stop ahead. You watch as the van drives methodically around the map, carrying its passengers from one location to another. The driver’s profile picture stares back at you, teasing you. The app glitches, and it's back to 11 minutes to arrival. Typical.

A tight feeling comes up in your stomach. You check the app and it's 10 minutes to arrival. You're the next stop. You question if it's worth it to try and find a bathroom or if you'll miss the ride. You contemplate the 2 minute waiting period. It's not worth it. You take a deep breath and dismiss your issue as nerves. 8 minutes to arrival.

The anticipation gnaws at you. You begin to break into a cold sweat as you contemplate what to say first. You get lost in your thoughts and are abruptly interrupted by an alert on your phone. Your Stingerette has arrived. You look up and see nothing. You feel betrayed. The app mocks you, displaying the alert while nothing sits in front of you. It's getting dark and the road is empty. As you turn around to walk back to the bench, you hear the distinctive sound of a Ford Van on asphalt.

You turn around and see the van parked on the curb, gather your nerves, and walk towards the vehicle. You open the door and another student is sitting in the first row listening to music. A wave of disappointment hits you as you climb in to the second row.

The driver asks where your destination is. You mutter a desolate ""NAV"". The person on the second row removes a headphone, and asks the driver to drop him off at the Klauss building up ahead. A wave of enjoyment hits you as you realize you will soon be alone with your beloved.

The vehicle pulls over outside the Klauss building and the student climbs out and thanks the driver. You slide into the first row like a eel into a wet cave. The driver looks at you inquisitively, but ignores your sly act. You work up the courage to speak.

You let out an overly enthusiastic ""Good evening!"". This startles the driver. They look at you in the mirror but do not respond. You get confident and try again.

""Hey, would you mind dropping me off in Tech Square by the Amazon store? I have a package...""

The driver looks at you in the mirror again, and utters a cold ""That area is out of my jurisdiction.""

You feel hopeless, but they look in to the mirror again and make eye contact with you. A sly smile comes on to their face as they say, ""It seems you already have a package"", and pan down your body. They grab the stick shift sensually.

This leaves you in shock, but intrigued. You slide into the passenger seat. The driver turns off the iPad and pulls into the parking area behind the CULC. You stare at each other for a moment before you make the first move. You lean in towards the driver's seat and plant kiss upon their lips. At that moment, you knew you were meant to be at Tech.

The kisses progress in intensity as the smell of old leather fills the environment. You feel the skilled hands of a well seasoned driver caress your back and reach for the base of your shirt. You repeat the sweet favor. The driver leans in and whispers ""I can put the STING in STINGERETTE"" You respond with a soft moan.

The driver reaches into the glove box and pulls out a condom. You strip the remaining articles of clothing as you climb into the driver's seat. This is the ride you had always wanted.

Like the pistons of engine, the driver goes to work methodically. The dipstick is well oiled. You can feel each stroke within you, repeatedly for the next several minutes. Like a bee pollinating a flower, you are satisfied.

The acts end with a sudden burst and a very loud moan. Your body bumps against the horn. You exchange another kiss as you laugh. The driver whispers, ""You've reached your destination.""

Thinking about the past few moments, you retrieve your clothes and quickly dress as not to get caught. You go to leave the van and plant one final kiss on the driver one last time. You make eye contact and share a smile.

As the door closes behind you and the van drives away, you look back at your phone. It prompts you to rate your experience.

You smile again as you leave 5 stars.",2018-07-12 07:08:40

It's been pretty great so far and I'm happy to have gotten out of school finally, but I got a nice reminder about 2 weeks ago about the advantages you get by having a degree from Tech. Our team got its first big deadline of the year in these past 2 weeks and it kind of hit us like a truck in that we're going to have to work really hard and possibly some weekends in order to hit it. What surprised me is how eerily similar this feels to a hell week - more specifically, the kind of pressure you're put under and the decisions you have to learn to make when you're subjected to that kind of stress. I'm grateful because getting the Tech degree actually taught me to survive and thrive in these high pressure situations by knowing how to properly prioritize and delegate, and as a result I'm having a much better time making a name for myself as the new guy who's only been at the job for 2 months but is getting shit done. Same goes for the other GT grads on my team, we all have and have maintained a really good reputation in the eyes of our management and the company as a whole, and I wholly attribute this to the mixture of technical competence, problem solving ability, and composure under stress that Tech instills in its graduates.     

We love to complain about Tech's downsides but it hasn't even been a year and I'm already so glad to be an alum of this school. Keep going at it! The payoff is worth it for sure.",2019-05-05 22:14:21

I was just in a collision with another cyclist at the 5th and Fowler intersection because the cyclist decided to make a left hand turn from the bike lane on the far right across TWO (2) lanes of traffic without indicating his intention to turn OR checking behind him to see if there was anyone coming. The crash knocked me off my bike (which is now without functioning brakes, thanks) and sent me skidding down the pavement. This is unacceptable. If I was in a car and we had been in the same type of collision, he would STILL be in the wrong.

If you are turning left, get in the turn lane. If you are turning at all, indicate that you are going to do so. If you plan on using the road in any way, shape, or manner, follow the signs that are in place to keep you safe! These are not just for cars! These are not optional!

I bike to and from campus every day from Home Park and see all manner of safety violations such as running red lights or biking across sidewalks.

President Cabrera is actually a genius?,275,ficboc,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/ficboc/president_cabrera_is_actually_a_genius/,26,1584185505,"There's been a lot of justified outrage and confusion over this whole move out situation with a lot of blame being flung around onto the USG and Cabrera. But what if this is all just the secret masterplan by Cabrera? He's always been on the go online train for a while, but he's not allowed to directly disobey the USG. So, in his great genius, he feigns a miscommunication and sends out an email telling students to go back home. Once that happens, he knows he has the upper hand. There's no way the USG can make us come back after moving out, right? Knowing the backlash would be harsh, he takes the hate from us alongside the USG to force them to go through with online classes for the rest of the semester.

Just think about it, why else would no other school message their students that school is going online for the rest of the semester? It couldn't have just been GT misunderstanding everything, right? Thank you President Cabrera for your sacrifice, and everyone go bitch to the USG right now so I can get my refund money.",2020-03-14 07:31:45

online class workload,276,imm15x,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/imm15x/online_class_workload/,27,1599274808,"has anyone felt that the online class workload is much greater than it would be in-person? I know some people mentioned this happening in the spring, but my profs then were more sympathetic to how difficult life was in the spring and I didn't notice this happening very much. 

now i'm starting to feel overwhelmed, not with the difficulty, but just the sheer amount of work there is. i'm doing my best to stay on top of it all, but it feels like a losing battle at this point. 

in one particular class, we're assigned recorded lectures before the actual class meeting and they can get up to 50 minutes of lecture, essentially doubling the class time. on top of the recorded lectures, there is VERY lengthy readings for every single class that we need to complete the weekly homework. the readings and weekly homework would likely be the same in person, but if we were in person, the class time would be used for lectures and not discussions. 

this prof is really nice so i though about contacting them just to (kindly) let them know that i'm trying my best but the amount of coursework required before class is becoming difficult to keep up with. i realize they've never taught this class online so maybe they just don't know what's realistic and what isn't?? but i'm worried that it might come across as complaining/seeming like I just don't want to do work. but at some point, no matter how much I want to complete the work, if I can't feasibly do it, isn't it just too much?

It is with profound sadness that I share news about the tragic deaths of two members of our undergraduate student community — Kevin Chang and Carter Johns. Both were true Yellow Jackets who contributed to the character and vibrancy of our community. 


Kevin, a fifth-year undergraduate electrical and computer engineering major, died as the result of an accident while at home with his family. Kevin was three weeks away from graduation. His degree will be awarded posthumously at the Commencement ceremony on December 15.


Carter, a fourth-year undergraduate double major in mathematics and materials science and engineering, died Tuesday morning in the Skiles Building. Carter was a stellar student and actively involved in several student organizations.


On behalf of Georgia Tech, we offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends who are coping with the shock, confusion, and grief resulting from this heartbreaking news. I have been in conversations with both students’ families — who have given us permission to share their names with the campus — and will continue to be there to support them.


As we grieve the loss of these promising young students, I want to encourage you to take care of yourselves and each other. If you are concerned about a friend, or classmate, or coworker, please let someone know so that an intervention can take place quickly. It is our collective responsibility to watch out for each other and to take appropriate action when needed.


To anyone who feels alone, scared, or desperate, please know that there are people at Georgia Tech who want to help you. For students affected by this tragedy, remember that the Counseling Center (counseling.gatech.edu)welcomes walk-ins in the Student Services (Flag) Building from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the week. They also offer support through the Peer Coaching Program for student-to-student support. The after-hours number for the Counseling Center is 404-894-2575.


Starting today through next Thursday (Dec. 6), the Counseling Center is extending its walk-in hours to 7 p.m. (weekdays). Students who are not current clients but wish to be seen for an initial consultation can get help without completing the intake paperwork. Additional Let’s Talk sessions have also been scheduled for next week. Students looking to speak with a counselor can visit the Clough Commons Communication Center (Room 447) on Monday (Dec. 3) from 10 a.m. until noon or on Tuesday (Dec. 4) from 2 to 4 p.m.


Psychiatry within Stamps Health Services provides general psychiatric services to undergraduate and graduate students and their spouses. Students interested in scheduling an appointment may call 404-894-2585 or stop by Psychiatry. (health.gatech.edu/services/psych)


Faculty and staff may access support through the Employee Assistance Program hwb.gatech.edu/eap or by calling 678-616-TECH (8324).


Finally, you can always reach out to my office, the Office of the Vice President and Dean of Students. We are available to meet and support students with any mental health or academic concerns, and we can connect students directly to campus resources (studentlife.gatech.edu). This office also has a referral option if you are concerned about a student (referral.studentlife.gatech.edu).

Feel fucked over by GT/USG,267,huhmtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/huhmtw/feel_fucked_over_by_gtusg/,31,1595262097,"Sooo I found out today that all of my classes are online. So now there is absolutely no reason for me to stay on campus but i’m already locked into the housing contract which will cost almost $5000 for a room for 3 months. I’m just under so much stress and sad because I don’t know what to do at this point because having my parents pay that much for no reason would be so upsetting but breaking it and being charged $600 would also be so frustrating. The fact that Georgia Tech made us decide on housing before we even know the status of our classes feels so deceitful and underhanded, and as an OOS student, when i Think about paying full tuition + fees to be stuck in my room the entire semester with what are probably going to be shitty prerecorded lectures, I start getting really anxious and panicky. Taking a semester off isn’t an option for me and my family has given up so much so I can go to Tech. But at this point, the administration feels so malicious to me and I just don’t feel comfortable anymore knowing that my well-being isn’t a top priority and GT/USG is only thinking about ways to shake me down for as much money as they can. It was my dream school but now i’m dreading returning this fall and feel nothing but resentment :( This school
has proven that it doesn’t act in the best interest of students and being at the mercy of an administration as evil as USG makes me so uncomfortable. 
Sorry for the vent, but I just don’t know what to do and I feel so helpless. At least now, hopefully my username makes sense",2020-07-20 12:21:37

Don't Buy a Meal Plan this Year,266,hxv5yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/hxv5yf/dont_buy_a_meal_plan_this_year/,64,1595743412,"I am making this post to give a few reasons why I think GT Dining is even worse than normal years. I do not suggest purchasing a meal plan if you can avoid it. 

The current system has dining making all the food in one location and delivering it to different places on campus.  Every meal would be the equivalent of almost $12. I ate the delivery meals for almost a month at the end of the Spring semester and ate almost everything on the menu.

**1) The portion sizes are not justified for the price.**  Each meal is paid for with either 1 meal swipe, dining dollars, or $11.71. In my experience of dozens of meals, the portions were not very filling, and I only need like 1700 calories a day. At least in previous years, a meal swipe would give you as much food as you want in a buffet style dining hall.

**2) Nutrition and protein is minimal/ all empty carbs.** Pretty much 70% of the meals are sugar, snack foods and chips, breads, or starches. If you are expecting any type of protein to keep you full, like beans, meat, fish, tofu, you'd be sad to see that the amount in each meal is minimal. I'd guess around 20g of protein a day for certain meals. These are $12 meals

**3) Vegan/ Vegetarian? Not for you.** Like I mentioned earlier the amount of protein available is minimal. They do have a veggie option for each meal, however I often found them to be the least filling.

**4) So Much Plastic Waste!** I know in the past years students have been pushing for more environmentally sustainable practices in dining, but I still think there is a long way to go. I was routinely filling up my recycling bin every few days with the amount of waste. Luckily the main containers the food come in are a cardboard type material instead of Styrofoam. However almost everything else is packaged in ""compostable"" poly-lactic acid (PLA). Yes PLA is compostable in an industrial setting at high temperatures with very specific enzymes, but under any conditions the plastic would likely encounter it would behave the same as any other plastic. It would not break down for a very long time.

**5) They'll probably kick us out halfway through Fall anyways.** You might as well keep that money on the side to pay for last minute storage, airline tickets, or medical bills.

**Conclusion:** I have nothing against dining employees and delivery drivers, but I think if you are going to spend $12 on delivery food, you will likely get a better value ordering from a small businesses in Atlanta. Even better you can have groceries delivered to reduce the money you spend, lower the carbon footprint of all the packaging waste and delivery trips, and continue honing your quarantine baking and cooking skills.",2020-07-26 02:03:32
my experience scheduling Fall 2020 classes as a prof,268,huu7xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/huu7xk/my_experience_scheduling_fall_2020_classes_as_a/,61,1595309378,"Hi Jackets,

I'm a humanities professor at Tech. In case you are interested, I'll share my experience trying to schedule classes for Fall 2020.

A few weeks ago, we were asked to rank our choices for the instructional mode of our classes (in-person, various types of hybrid that are all apparently actually the same, or online -- but online is only for people with medical issues). Beacuse I was told that in-person was the preferred default, I listed that as my top choice for my classes. (I'm new and eager to please!)

Currently, my classes are listed as hybrid. In that scenario, I was thinking of doing regular outdoor meetups for my students to chat about what they've been reading/learning together, and to give them some structured socio-intellectual time to make friends and feel like part of a community. (Is that what you all want? It's what I was thinking I might want as a student).

But NOW, I have learned that my classes might actually be in-person rather than hybrid (unclear when I'll know this?) if they can find a room for this. Although we were told that in-person classes would be the default, it now seems like hybrid has become the de facto default. So I am a bit worried about being in the minority of faculty to teach in-person. Will students even want to take an in-person class? I have no idea. It's pretty stressful for me to not know what form my classes will take next month, and to worry about whether students will even want to take an in-person class if that's what I am assigned to teach. (I did buy my own air purifier to bring to campus in case I teach in-person!)

I am also curious about what the students want. Do you all want in-person classes? Do you want online classes? What do you want a ""hybrid"" class to look like?

When I thought my classes were hybrid, I was planning to have pretty regular meetups. But it seems like some of my colleagues -- especially those who are parents of children who will be doing at-home learning -- are planning to have very few in-person meetups for their hybrid classes, perhaps making the entire concept a bit of a farce. (Are students okay with that? I don't know.)

I just thought I would share this perspective in case any of you are wondering about the professors' end. I am also interested to learn more about what students actually want/need/expect from us in the Fall.",2020-07-21 01:29:38

This is an obvious PSA that everyone knows but doesn't really think about.

I graduated back in 2015. Have been working in Silicon Valley ever since. I never took my physical health seriously and always just grinded through each day. Thinking I could get through on my intellect alone. Long story short. I've destroyed my body since graduation. Really, since I started at tech. Sitting all the time. Not caring about my posture. Whatever position I had to sit in to get my brain focused.

Well. Now I'm working at a job that I can't perform at because after years and years of sitting and living a sedentary lifestyle I can't type on a computer for more than 10 minutes without wanting to kill myself. I'm only in my mid 20s and I feel like I'm an old man.

I always told myself: I'll get in shape after school. It'll be easier then. Well, it doesn't always get easier and you don't always have more time. Sometimes worse shit happens in your life later and you end up pouring everything into a career that is slowly killing you day by day. And all you had to do was do some planks every now and then.

Don't end up like me. All those smarts will go away if your body starts going into survival mode telling you ""Nope, you're done looking at a screen. All I can do is either give up or go for a run. We're shutting down that intellect because it's killing you""

So, this is the the stage I'm at. Really hope this helps someone. We weren't evolved to sit all the time. We were evolved to be athletic as well as intelligent. They go hand in hand. Take it from someone that decided to only choose one. Its not a choice you want to make. Take some time to take care of your physical health. Even if it means you get less study time in. You'll think clearer and for longer and you'll start to notice you're also happier. 

Good luck everyone. Take care of yourselves.",2019-04-22 20:47:55

In Memoriam: Brandon Adams,254,b4xyn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/b4xyn5/in_memoriam_brandon_adams/,23,1553472290,"(Got this email a few minutes ago)

Georgia Tech mourns the loss of student-athlete Brandon Adams, who died on March 23 in Atlanta. He was 21.

Adams was a business administration major and rising senior football student-athlete. Off the field, he spent the summer of 2018 interning for the world-renowned Georgia Tech Research Institute.

Born Dec. 22, 1997, Brandon Alonzo Adams is survived by his mother, Lisa Greer, stepfather, Reginald Woods, and sister, Rian. Memorial information is not available at this time.

“All of us here at Georgia Tech send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Brandon Adams,” said Georgia Tech President G.P. “Bud” Peterson. “We ask that you keep them in your thoughts and prayers.”

Adams played in 33 games over three seasons as a Yellow Jacket from 2016-18. He recorded 41 career tackles, 6.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles as an interior defensive lineman. He was coming off a career year in 2018, when he amassed 24 tackles, five tackles for loss and two forced fumbles in 13 games (all career highs).

“On behalf of the entire Georgia Tech athletics family, I offer my deepest condolences to Brandon’s family and friends, including his past and present coaches, and his brothers in the Georgia Tech football family,” said Todd Stansbury, Georgia Tech director of athletics. “As we mourn the loss of such an incredible young life, we are also here to support Brandon’s family and friends, his past and present coaches and his brothers within the Georgia Tech football family in any way that we can. Please join us in keeping Brandon and everyone who loved him in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.”

A Brentwood, Tennessee, native, Adams was a three-sport star at Brentwood Academy (football, wrestling, track and field). He served as captain for Brentwood Academy’s football and track and field teams that both won state championships during his senior year (2015-16). In all, he earned 11 high school letters (four in football, four in track and field, three in wrestling) and helped lead four Brentwood Academy teams to state titles (football – 2015; track and field – 2013, 2015 and 2016).

“Our entire Georgia Tech football family is heartbroken by the news of Brandon’s passing,” said Geoff Collins, Georgia Tech football head coach. “In the short time that I have had the privilege and honor of knowing Brandon, I admired and respected him, first and foremost as a terrific human being, but also as an outstanding teammate and leader. Jennifer and I offer our thoughts, prayers and unconditional support to his parents, Lisa and Reginald, his sister, Rian, and all of his family and friends, particularly his brothers in our football program.”",2019-03-24 20:04:50

These are your USG Board of Regents. Some basic facts:

* The Board of Regents is composed of 19 members, five of whom are appointed from the state-at-large, and one from each of the state’s 14 congressional districts.
   * The number is projected to be the same for the next decade because we are unlikely to gain or lose any congressional seats after the 2020 census
   * Although they oversee all 26 USG institutions, at least eight of them are UGA alumni and only at least two are Georgia Tech alumni
   * Five (27.78%) are women
   * Two African-Americans\^, Two Hispanic White, One Asian. Georgia is 60% white, but BoR is 83.33% white (both non-Hispanic and Hispanic)
   * Only ONE of them have any experience in higher education prior to being appointed \*(Regent Hames was a public school teacher and a current Headmaster of a private school; Regent Perez was an adjunct professor for 10 years)
* The governor appoints members of the Board to a seven-year term and regents **may be reappointed to subsequent terms** by a sitting governor.
   * At least two of them are serving their third governor.
   * TEN of them will still serve on New Year's Day 2025
   * There is no student, faculty, or staff input in the entire process, apart from the confirmation by the State Legislature, which is elected by all of us in our role as ordinary citizens.
   * The UC System, for example, has one [Voting Student Regent](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/members-and-advisors/student-regent.html)
* Regents donate their time and expertise to serve the state through their governance of the University System of Georgia – **the position is a voluntary one without financial remuneration**.
* Upon a recommendation from the **Executive and Compensation Committee**, the Board of Regents shall consider any situation in which a Regent has not fulfilled his or her duty as set forth in Board Bylaws, Board Policy, and applicable law and take appropriate action as the board deems necessary to include removal of the Board member.
   * The Executive and Compensation Committee of the Board shall consist of the Chair of the Board, the Vice Chair of the Board, and the Chancellor (ex officio and nonvoting) and include at least four but not more than six members of the Board who are appointed by the Board Chair. The Board Chair shall serve as Chair of the Executive and Compensation Committee, and the Chancellor or his/her designee shall serve as the Committee’s secretary.
   * **Not even the Governor or the State Legislature can remove any of the Regents. Only USG BoR can do that to themselves. T**his makes sense from a standpoint of academic independence, ie. in a change of administration, the Governor can't fire all the Regents and replace them with his trusted aides. But it also means change happens extremely slowly

More [info](https://www.usg.edu/regents/) here. Now you know the facts, the most important part is to start putting direct pressure.

1. The State Legislature is having an election this fall. They approve any new appointments to BoR. There is absolutely no excuse not to vote.
2. The number of valid signatures required for a recall election of Governor Brian Kemp is equal to at least 15 percent of the number of electors who were registered and qualified to vote in the preceding election for that office, ie. 1,035,000 signatures. At least one-fifteenth of the signatures, ie. 69,000 signatures must come from residents in each of the congressional districts in Georgia.
3. Members of the BoR serve on numerous Chambers of Commerce and large corporations such as Morgan Stanley, CBRE, Inc., Hull Property Group,  Berkshire Hathaway, and BankSouth. You can express your displeasure towards them to these companies.
4. Demand the establishment of Student and Faculty/Staff Regents. We deserve not only to be in the table but to be heard and taken seriously.",2020-07-22 17:54:09

Current GT folks: I won't insult you saying that ""it gets better"" pretending that it stays better, it changes, often for the better. Your frustrations and problems change.

We are all tough and competent. Intelligence is an after thought. I hope your definition of ""success"" for yourself expands as other alums reply.

I'm arguing from a different perspective: that if we do not offer P/F as an option, then we are reducing the educational standard that Georgia Tech holds.

Our academic transcript, including GPA, is very much a reflection of our success during college (whether or not that's a good system is a different story). As the majority of top 50 schools have switched their grading policy, employers and schools will look at Spring 2020 and put different weight on it. If we simply allow exact letter grades to affect our transcript the same as any other semester, then we are accepting this: the quality of education we offer this Spring is the same, despite the rapid shifts to student and faculty lives.

**By not changing our grading policy, we are accepting that our on-campus resources including tutoring, study spaces, and lab work, do not add necessary value or enrich the student learning experience**. While many students can and will succeed on their own, we are accepting that when all students are stripped from support they paid for, they should be judged with the same criteria.

Leaving flexibility up to individual professors is not enough. I've already read that some are increasing workload due to lost time and say that now, the students have more time to focus. The class I TA has made good changes, in my opinion, by pushing back deadlines and reducing the scope of our final project. However, as every teacher has a different perspective and motive, we need a systemic change which prioritizes the interest of the students first.

We are defined by the quality of our students and their learning environment. If we act as if this academic semester is no different from others, then we are diminishing the value that Georgia Tech offers.",2020-03-23 21:12:49

Gym Etiquette,250,fcl765,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/fcl765/gym_etiquette/,37,1583220574,"TLDR:  There are too many people for the CRC. Be aware of how much time you spend on a singular machine, especially with big groups. Don’t block paths or areas, let people work in. Limit phone use to changing songs and returning texts. No YouTube videos or Netflix (unless you’re on a cardio machine then go for it). Do not use multiple machines at once. Don’t creep on girls. Happy lifting friends.


Hello people, I’m a 3rd year and I’ve been a CRC regular my entire time here. I’ve always noticed stuff in the CRC that ticks me off but I’ve always tried to ignore it. There are frankly way too many people at this school for the CRC but even if another was to be built i wouldn’t be here for it. To help (maybe?) I think it would be best that etiquette is explained to people that are just starting in the gym, or aren’t really sure how stuff works in there.

Time in between sets - Take only the length of breaks you need for your workout type. No rest should be longer than 5 minutes (extreme strength training, PRs) and most of the types of workouts I see in the CRC should have 30-90 seconds rest in between. It’s really crowded in there most of the day and taking long breaks backs everything up so much for everyone. The worst thing I see are people casually on their phones using social media or watching YouTube. (I saw one guy lay on a bench and watch and entire 13 minute video). People came to workout so don’t waste their time, it’s a shared space and you aren’t the only person putting in that sweet sweaty work. 

Large groups - At this school more than others I’ve worked out at (2 separate universities) people love to come in large groups. It’s completely fine to do that, however, keep in mind that you will be taking up much more time on the machines. In the same thread you will have “mandatory” breaks because someone else from your group will be using the machine. The problem comes from when a group comes in, grabs a machine, and then has 5 minutes in between separate people going because they are all conversing in between sets. I’ve seen many groups spend 30< minutes on machines when they could have finished in 15. 

Amount of machines in use - the only time it’s acceptable to use more than one machine is on the cable machines or if you are in a group that is alternating (in a timely manner). Another part of this is to not take all the free weights. There is absolutely no need for anyone to have more than 2 sets of dumbbells at a bench. If you want to do a drop set then get in front of the weights and put them back after your set, then move to the next set. If you are in a large group, and there are two of the same machines (except cardio) don’t take more than one. Take turns and rotate at a reasonable speed and you’ll be fine.

Spatial awareness - things are tight in the CRC so this is extremely important. Do not hit anyone’s weight in the middle of a lift, I have had this happen 3 times and it’s an extreme injury hazard. It’s better to wait 20 seconds then tear someones rotator cuff because they are trying to stabilize the weight.

Putting the weights back - if you take something from somewhere, put it back where it goes. It’s not hard.

Blocking paths - don’t put weights in the way of walking paths or in front of the racquetball courts. That the only place weighted lunges can be done. Also don’t have your group of 15 form a plank circle in the way of everyone. 

The rest will be kind of miscellaneous things.

It’s ok to get creative with your workouts (using cable machines for low rows, having a set of dumbbells by your machine and doing sets while on you break for the machine). It is not ok to take bars from benches and racks to do curls. 

If someone asks to work in, be nice and let them.

If you notice someone waiting in the machine you are using and you know you won’t be done for a while, tell them and maybe offer to let them work in.

It’s ok to make noises while lifting but there is no need to scream “lightweight baby” at your 185 lb bench. 

If you need a spot, ask. Most people are happy to help.

Sometimes people might try to correct your form, it’s hard to tell if it’s because they are genuinely worried about you getting hurt or they want to flex their knowledge. I know if I see someone confused on how to do something I generally try to help.

Guys, the gym is not a place to hit on girls. Just don’t do it.

Go get fit my dudes",2020-03-03 02:29:34

A public request to the moderators of this sub.,245,gv7qnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/gv7qnk/a_public_request_to_the_moderators_of_this_sub/,73,1591134825,"Morning r/gatech. I am a pretty active member of this sub who believes this is one of the best GT communities that can be found online. Like most of you, I have been reading over the mod's latest [rule revision](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/guw9cf/state_of_the_subreddit_an_update_from_the_mods/). However, I have issues with the rule changes and wanted to make a post to discuss my specific issues, which are shared by many of you. Here is the new rule, copy-pasted for those that don't want to flip back to the [previous page](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/guw9cf/state_of_the_subreddit_an_update_from_the_mods/):        

.        

> Don’t be a jerk:
Being a Jerk may include, but is not limited to...:
    Racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, religious discrimination, name-calling, dog-whistling, etc... Trolling or flaming.
    Participation must be in good faith.
    We uphold the legacy of Georgia Tech as a leader in civil rights and expect participants to behave accordingly. We want meaningful and/or entertaining discussions on this subreddit. We do not want people to feel antagonized or ostracized for any reason and want all topics discussed openly like adults. Intolerance will not be tolerated. Be productive and contribute meaningfully.
    Judgement is left to moderator discretion.            

Now on paper, this is great. Transphobia is bad, and dog-whistling can sometimes be harmful. For those who don't know what dog-whistling is, here is a reputable [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/dog-whistle-political-meaning) I found.          

So, if I appear fine with the added clarifications, then why am I writing this post? It is because of the last line of the rule change:                    

> Judgement is left to moderator discretion.            

I have a massive problem with this line. After reading the rest of the post, my interpretation is the moderators are becoming annoyed with the users of this subreddit not agreeing with their beliefs to a T. This conclusion is further supported by other lines in their post, namely this one:           

> Silence on this topic is a tacit agreement with the status quo, and it is something that neither I nor the other mods can accept. We’ve been fairly hands-off thus far, ceding most of the control over content to the community, but issues like this necessitate action to make sure that everyone can feel welcome.            

The moderators explicitly say **they** are not comfortable with agreeing with the status quo. **This is a political stance which is not shared by all of the members of this subreddit**. Myself, I also dislike the status quo. However, that is a personal political opinion brought about by my upbringing, experiences in life, and worldview. I know many intelligent, well-informed GT students who are perfectly content with the current political situation. Therefore, even though I agree with the moderators' views in this case, I simply cannot support their aim to censor students in order to spread their own views. By ostracizing your general population in an attempt to represent minorities better, you will drive away more participants than you gain.              

.       


Therefore, I have a public proposal for the moderators: **allow us to moderate what content we believe is representative of our beliefs. Do not censor speech or statistics you disagree with under the guise of preventing dog-whistling, but instead rationally argue against it and provide counter-evidence. Allow us to downvote racist comments and dispute their posters. Seeing a racist comment with -19 downvotes is much more empowering than just seeing [removed] 7 times in a comment thread. We, as a community, are capable of determining what we agree and disagree with by ourselves.**            

For anyone who wants to read a bit more discussion on the topic, I found [this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/guw9cf/state_of_the_subreddit_an_update_from_the_mods/fsl2x8i/) on the main post to have some solid insights.               

Finally, moderators, know I truly admire you for taking a strong stance on these issues. I will never criticize anyone for standing up for what they believe, even if I disagree with said beliefs. However, you should spread your ideals in the same way the rest of us do: by discussion and debate, rather than merely censoring those opposed to you. In your main post, you encouraged us to converse and discuss with people who have different worldviews than us. How are we supposed to do that if everyone who disagrees with us is no longer comfortable commenting and posting on this subreddit?            

Anyways, I am posting this hoping to generate discussion, rather than just preach my views. Please comment and let me know if you agree, disagree, etc. As always, I am proud to be a member of this community, and go Yackets!         

.        

.       

Edit 1: If I may, I would like to propose a basic solution: what if the mods were to remove all posts and comments with more than X downvotes, where X is a number we agree upon as a community (maybe 20, just to throw out a number). This way, mods can still remove harmful content but **we, the community** have much more of a say in the matter. Also, I want to make it clear that I approve of the mods removing non-GT-related content. That is not censorship as it simply does not belong on this sub.",2020-06-02 17:53:45

Dear Freshies and Anyone Else Really,238,i7epc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/i7epc5/dear_freshies_and_anyone_else_really/,56,1597125629,"As my user suggests I’m a RA, specifically a freshman hall RA.

So lemme hit u with some stuff I saw on Saturday when freshman moved in. No mask or social distancing all around. On my hall, I saw this and I told them where the masks at my dudes and they were like, “oh my mask, i seem to have forgotten it. Oh dear u want me to go grab it from my room??” 

Yes dumbfuck

I’m just dumbfounded, star struck, anything that expresses sheer awe at the stupidity of the responses. I can confidently say from what I have seen around all of East campus, for freshman, more than 50% do not social distance, do not wear masks, and about 25% are hanging in groups of like 10+. I like to walk around a lot and be active so I have really spent time seeing and considering what I say rn. Because they are young or smt, they think it won’t affect them but we don’t have long term studies on covid, and some people have short term lung scarring so if u are afflicted badly but survive, this shit might not heal permanently. Also, they think all young people are immune but that is also false since although the chance is small, a chance exists for a fatality to be one of our own, not to mention our professors or cleaning staff and other staff who can be rather old (like 30- 60 years of age fr). If 25% of campus got it, then it’s fair to assume atleast 1 person might die or get irreplaceable damage. Someone from our community could be wrecked for life. Because tech refused to make things online for quick mandatory fee snatching session, because USG is sucking Kemp’s little weiner, because a lot of people from Georgia (you guys will hate for this), not sure if it’s because more than half our campus is trump and/or kemp supporters, think the mask is an accessory. They genuinely think that wearing a mask is something lame or just for kicks. And it’s guys and girls across the board, if u want racial demographics (didn’t wanna do it but I gotta call y’all out) it’s mostly Caucasian people (probably because parents of that race just tend to be less strict with it thinking it’s not a big problem or wtvr, but it is).

Also, wanna know smt else. When I was a PL, now called RA, in past years the biggest hygiene problems guys and girls alike had was washing hands after using the bathroom. You guys might think it’s a joke, but freshman fr went into stalls to take a dump and just walked out onto the floor. Now, I saw the same thing yesterday and I was internally raging, like I had to call this mfer out. Imagine now, freshman don’t take precautions, don’t care, AND DONT WASH HANDS TOO. It’s just asking to be a Petri dish for covid. 

So where am I going w this. 

Please go home if u don’t absolutely need to be here. Someone else posted this but it took a dark but true turn towards the end which garnered a lot of hate from the redditors on here (the diction really got out of hand and some of the points were just like, who hurt u type of things). Point is, if u can commute do that. In fact if you wanna stay in atl that’s cool. Just go off campus to an apartment, it’s literally cheaper because of covid and people still having leases. But for fucks sake please don’t stay in on campus housing dorms (apartment style is ok but really the leases are cheaper, nicer, and safer for isolating yourself) and don’t hang out around here in large ass groups and have no mask on because I and nobody else tryna get covid out here. If u wanna hang, distance yourself, pleaseee, have a mask on PLEASEEE.

At the very fucking least, go get the free testing done when it comes back to the advertised locations because I just want to see all the positives start coming in. I’m a 4th year so I don’t want to lose my time on campus, but you know what, if I didn’t have my goddamn 2 diff lab classes, I would yeet the fuck out for the sake of other people and because GT housing administration is making some RAs like me do much more work than we are supposed to. I might be running it up to HR kind of work.

So guys take that as u will, just know I hate that tech even opened up again, should have stayed remote for the semester. I know you just got here or are getting here but don’t be in oncampus housing please, go to midtown and lease for a semester (literally cheaper than housing dorm/apartment fee and fully furnished with non sus af utilities and furniture), go back home if it’s feasible asap. Campus is likely gonna go back to partial shutdown mode so u might as well make the switch sooner than later when u haven’t actually paid for the full housing fee. 

Counters-

Freshman want the experience of college: I am so sorry you can’t get the experience u wanted and u have no idea how much it hurt my heart and other RAs hearts to tell freshman “hey we can’t have this hang out because u can’t social distance (in the lounge where 12 people are gathered)” and any other semester I would have literally been so happy that people were taking initiative to make friends. But not this year with what I saw. We the RAs need to be the bad guy because we have look out for everyone’s safety which the freshman really couldn’t care less about. Wearing a mask isn’t second nature to people. Furthermore, if day zero was like how I and others described, imagine what one week from now will be like. Imagine freshman rushing and hanging with some of the frats which already have been wilding over summer with covid positive people. GT only brought u here with ‘hybrid’ or ‘in person’ to get ur money and kick u out when covid becomes an issue. It’ll leave a bad taste in your mouth and I think what’s better is to push for GT to do some kind of welcome to campus event in the spring semester for all the first years. Rn, the events are virtual anyways so being here just puts u in risk with no in person reward/experience. There are in person events but those are literally full of people and huge crowds hanging together w no mask so how safe is it even if they attendance cap (it’s not btw, /s). Anyways, By spring we will be past the covid peak (curve of cases vs recovered) and although it wouldn’t be 100% safe, it would be immensely safer than rn and a vaccine is predicted with high confidence to be out by Jan/feb.  

first time away from bad home environment or some other reason that they need to be herr on campus over home- LEASE OFF CAMPUS, it’s cheap af, places are fully furnished, so many aug-dec specific leases so u won’t get stuck in a fully commited year round thing, literally better than housing in every facet.

Con to this is making friends which will be hard if not living on campus on the dorm, but I think u could still attempt to hang safely. Also ur freshman hall friends are in more cases than not, people who in later years become more like friend/acquaintances and only some freshman og groups actually form. Plus u had time to meet them since u moved in so u don’t need to leave ASAP but u know who some of the people are and if ur near campus u could always hang and still build those relationships. 


There are so many things wrong with this year and I just want to say sorry, sorry for everything. There are pros and cons to being on campus but the cons are much greater and being home/off campus housing this semester is honestly the move from a safety, higher standard of living, and comfort standpoint. Please know while I cannot put myself in ur shoes I do empathize for ur situation because I was also a freshman at a point and those random hangouts w the hall friends were events I valued a lot. But also as a freshman, I would have reasoned that because I haven’t made any deep bonds yet it would be less painful to yeet out now and save money, than to yeet out in September or whenever we close but lose money on lwk bad housing and the emotional loss getting ur intro to college snatched away

Those are my words, I know lots of people will hate so go ahead ig, I’m just looking out for u guys and want u to know that money health emotion wise, being invested in this semester might be a mistake and pulling looks like a good option.

Sincerely,
An RA that loves residents having fun but loves their safety more

At $20 a pop (https://store.gallup.com/h/en-us), it will provide you five adjectives to describe your personality to coordinate with your astrological symbol.

To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed evidence that this is an effective way to increase teamwork productivity. Can we have a discussion about why Dr. Mary Lynn Realff from MSE, an associate professor who has not produced any research results in recent years, continues to push this onto the campus at large? Why is she getting paid nearly $170,000/year to only run the MSE mentorship program and shill this program (https://community.asme.org/members/marylynnrealff107/default.aspx)?

I'm more than happy to rethink my bias provided evidence, but there is very little transparency as to why StrengthsFinder is being pushed so hard.

Edit: It's been brought up that Dr. Realff is also the MSE undergrad program head (http://www.mse.gatech.edu/people/mary-realff). This is a demanding position which I failed to mention earlier.

Edit 2: I rescind and amend my statements and tone about Dr. Realff's position, and I'd like to limit the discussion to the merit of StrengthsFinder.

[Rant] Georgia Tech Maintainence is a Money Laundering Scheme (pun intended),236,apcykp,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/apcykp/rant_georgia_tech_maintainence_is_a_money/,27,1549891340,"I paid good money to go to this renowned university. You'd at least expect the dryers at Brittain Rec to work. But no. Georgia Tech maintenance refuses to fix these broken dryers (believe me, I've tried asking). Half of the dryers are broken and there's no way of knowing unless a kindhearted ~~victim~~ individual puts up a sign saying so. For those of us that are unfortunate to discover a broken dryer, we are robbed of our time and money. This has to be illegal. They owe me at least $20 in Buzzfunds lost to these money-eating machines, but at least in the short term, I'm still waiting for my clothes to dry after finally finding a working dryer AND I WANT TO GO TO FUCKING BED ALREADY!

I get that there are some instances where you need a space to work with other people, but I feel a vast majority of studying is done silently and alone. The new library currently has little to no individual seats and the quiet 6th and 7th floors aren't quiet at all. (I know the signage is on its way or whatever but I think they could print a few pieces of paper with ""QUIET FLOOR"" and tape it to the tables) The library under construction is planning to have no quiet floors at all. I feel like schools love to throw around the words like ""collaborative"" and ""interactive"" for study areas without actually knowing what some students want. The majority of campus is already full of collaborative study spaces but the only place where you could study alone and in the quiet just got taken away and there's no plan to replace it. If you want to study outside your room in a quiet area, at an individual desk, there's like twenty seats available to the entire student body. If you want to study with other people you have the dining halls, Willage, Skiles Walkway, the CULC, Scheller, the new library, and soon, the under construction library. How is this fair to the people who like to study alone? I personally like to study in the quiet without distractions and without having to share a table with ten other people. GaTech would rather have the ability to brag about how ""collaborative"" their campus is than provide a usable study space for students who actually want to study.",2019-01-15 23:54:39

My embarrassing BlueJeans story,226,g3ip49,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/g3ip49/my_embarrassing_bluejeans_story/,18,1587218780,"Well, this just happened today - or rather, I just found out about it today - and I figure some of you may get a chuckle out of it. I sure hope to.. eventually.

Since my first semester at Tech, I'd attend this psuedo-GT1000 hangout where myself and a few friends would get some coffee at the Culc, talk about our week, and generally toss around for an hour. We've since been using Bluejeans and have been trying to keep the fun going in liue of being face-to-face. Last week, for example, we decided we'd change our monikers for that meeting to our 'stripper names' as a joke. Now I'd actually played a similar game during a Tech Trek last year, so I just went with the name I made up back then: 'Grandmaster Shamrock', playing off my Northern Irish background. Fun times, good craic, we closed the session after the hour and everyone got on with their weekend plans. This was the 10th of April, seven days ago.

Fast forward to this morning: I was cooking some eggs while listening to my professor's lecture with my mic and camera off (the standard for his class). He was discussing the history of film for a moment before coming to a somewhat abrupt pause in his speech: 'I do have one question though,' he said, his voice relatively unassuming and my eyes still focused on the frying pan, 'which one of you is ""Grandmaster Shamrock?""'. I froze, almost dropping my wooden spoon onto the eggs. I couldn't believe the sound of my fake stripper name leaving my professor's mouth. ""Grandmaster Shamrock?"", He repeated. Turning on the mic after the awkward wake of silence, I remarked how I was terribly embarrassed, and, rather than explain the situation truthfully, told him my peculiar title was for an 'educational role-playing session' of a previous class. I thought it sounded good at the time - a class I had last semester had a historical role-playing exercise - but the more I recollect the more it seems like a most strange retort, especially to the other students in the class, all of whom were completely silent during my mad ramble. I'm sure everyone was racking their heads trying to think of the context that the denomination Grandmaster Shamrock would be used educationally. In hindsight, role-playing and stripper names don't mix that well as an excuse.

I'm in LMC, so save for one elective I have no courses with more than 30 people - relatively small classes. Being called out in one was bad enough, but I soon realized that meant I've been attending these more personable lectures for a week now, asking questions, responding to prompts, often on camera, all under the guise of Shamrock, and no one corrected me until Friday morning. If memory serves, there are at least three courses (excluding the aforementioned) when the Grandmaster has made an appearance instead of my identifiable name. Perhaps the worst part is I've had two 8AM lectures where I don't recall speaking, so I now have to email that professor to let her know I actually did attend class, albeit as my stripper alter-ego.

I hate to be dogmatic, but if there's a moral to this story: always, *always* check and change your name back if needs be - it does *not* reset after each meeting. Apparently.

Tldr: forgot to change my BlueJeans moniker back from my fake stripper name and was called out in class.",2020-04-18 10:06:20

[PSA] Surveillance Testing Currently Underutilized,224,icf8z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/icf8z8/psa_surveillance_testing_currently_underutilized/,10,1597833037,"As per this webpage ( [https://health.gatech.edu/surveillance-testing-program-results](https://health.gatech.edu/surveillance-testing-program-results) ) 5175 tests have been conducted so far, since August 9. This averages to roughly 520 tests conducted per day.  This is skewed because for the past week, campus has only had mostly freshman - but today, only 900 tests were conducted (as per some discord bot tracking this, I can't find a way on the webpage to track daily # tests), despite most people having moved onto campus by now.  Our testing capacity, meanwhile, is 1500 tests per day. Anecdotally, there has been no line whatsoever both times I went to go get tested. 

&#x200B;

So:

0.) Get tested. Not just today, but weekly. Designate a certain ""test day"" every week if you must. Getting tested just once doesn't accomplish much - weekly testing is far more powerful.

1.) Tell everyone you know to get tested if they haven't, and tell them to get tested weekly. This is one of the most powerful ways to avoid a repeat of March.

&#x200B;

Testing takes literally 5 minutes. You basically spit in a cup. For how much we've shit on GT/USG COVID response, I'm pleasantly surprised by our testing plans. There were initial hiccups in getting test results back, but my most recent test came back in 36 hours.

&#x200B;

Also, keep in mind that we are currently using pooled testing. Pooled testing, AFAIK, is effective when infection rates are low. It helps you stop a small fire before it becomes a forest fire. But if infection rates rise, pooled testing quickly becomes useless - many sample pools will come back positive, and you'll need to retest those people individually. So we need to be proactive with this, because if pooled testing breaks down, we lose a very critical weapon in the fight against this virus.",2020-08-19 06:30:37

A little context, I am uber stressed. Not gonna list why bc everyone here is stressed. But just know that I am WAY more so than I normally am. It’ll add to the story I guess.

So I went to the store to grab some supplies for the weekend.. you know the usual Friday stuffs. Anyway the guy who drove me was in a rush so he dropped me off at the North Avenue Curb and left me with the maximum amount of plastic bags and one heavy “cardboard box” a well condition man could possibly carry back in one trip. I’m like, “okay this will hurt but I think I make it back to East by myself.” (All other friends are gone or in class).

I loop bags around my forearms and carry the box in my free hands. Around the Volleyball court, Publix Shitty Plastic Bags TM © rip and my and shit goes everywhere.

This is the worst part.

While I’m already on the ground feeing like an idiot picking stuff up and reconsolidating bags...  I hear someone say, “Hey do you need any help?” I look up and blankly stare at this super cute girl. I was like....  “Uhhhh... nooo that’s okay.”

She was like, “are you sure!? It’s really no problem.” Guys idk what to say, I froze.. very out of character. I was like “uhhhhhhh it’s okay I live all the way in East thanks tho.” (Presuming she was walking towards south)

She again was smiling and like “are you really sure!?” Like an idiot I was like “yeah thank you tho.” Guys I was already stressed and VERY rushed I just immediately regretted saying no to her help. I wanted to chase her down and apologize and thank her again but she was too far and I had too much stuff.

Now I’m also stressed about this haha. 

In my mind, best case scenario, one of your friends is a cute brunette girl (maybe 5’ 7”ish) that (maybe) lives in North Ave South and told you about trying to help some loser out and he refused and you’ll tell her to message me for a proper thank you!

Worst case scenario, I become a meme.
Actually that’d probably be second best case.

I guess average case nothing happens ):
